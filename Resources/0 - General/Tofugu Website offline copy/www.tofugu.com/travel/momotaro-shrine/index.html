<p>Stepping out of the taxi in Aichi Prefecture, I headed toward this ancient and remote <abbr title="The native religion of Japan which emphasizes connection with the natural world and national folklore.">Shinto</abbr> shrine. As soon as you lay eyes on it, you'll know what makes this shrine unique.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="torii gate at momotaro shrine" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/torii.jpg" /></figure>

<p>It took two trains and two and a half hours to see this:</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="monkey statue at momotaro shrine" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/monkey.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Sitting beneath the <abbr title="A gate found at the entrance of Shinto shrines. It marks the beginning of sacred ground.">torii</abbr> gate is a monkey with a peach on his chest. This is a painted concrete statue of the monkey from Japanese folktale Momotarō. It was created by <a href="https://japandaily.jp/momotaro-jinja-the-surreal-shrine-to-the-boy-born-of-a-peach-2207/?utm_source=Tofugu">Asano Shoun</a>, a famous Japanese sculptor who transformed this ordinary shrine into a full-on Momotarō Park.</p>

<p>And this monkey was just the beginning.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="japanese demon holding a flag" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/oni.jpg" /></figure>

<blockquote class="highlight-right">
  <p>When it comes to Japanese fairy tales, Momotarō is definitely tops. If Japanese folk heroes had a Justice League, he would be Superman.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the left of the entrance was an <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr> holding a flag that read "Momotarō Shrine." Remember from the story, Momotarō conquered the <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr> and made them all his servants. So I guess this one was forced to sit and hold a sign all day.</p>

<p>If you don't know the story of Momotarō let me fill you in real quick:</p>

<p>An <abbr title="The Japanese word for &quot;grandfather&quot; or &quot;old man.&quot;">ojīsan</abbr> and <abbr title="The Japanese word for &quot;grandmother&quot; or &quot;old woman.&quot;">obāsan</abbr> find a giant peach. A baby boy jumps out of that peach. The baby boy is named Momotarō or "Peach Boy" (<i>momo</i> <ruby>桃<rp>（</rp><rt></rt><rp>）</rp></ruby> means "peach" and <i>tarō</i> <ruby>太郎<rp>（</rp><rt></rt><rp>）</rp></ruby> is a suffix meaning "boy"). He grows up and befriends a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant. They all go on a journey to conquer an island full of Japanese ogres.</p>

<p>Momotarō and the animals beat the crap out of the ogres, turn them into servants, and steal all their treasure. The villagers, of course, are overjoyed to have lots of treasure and demon servants. Momotarō marries the village elder's daughter and everyone lives happily ever after.</p>

<p>When it comes to Japanese fairy tales, Momotarō is definitely tops. If Japanese folk heroes had a Justice League, he would be Superman.</p>

<p>Hopefully that will help you understand just how awesome these statues are.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="momotaro dog and pheasant sculptures" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/dog-and-pheasant.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Like the pheasant and the dog, who were waiting past the gate to greet me. They both look very serious. Relax, guys. You already conquered the <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr>.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="momotaro monkey" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/monkey-and-duo.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Next to the pheasant and dog was another monkey, but this one looked more sinister than the first one holding that golden ball. Better not look this monkey in the eyes or he might take it as a sign of aggression.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="silkie chicken in japan" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/silkie.jpg" /></figure>

<p>As I walked further into the shrine, I ran into an <i>ukokkei</i> <ruby>烏骨鶏<rp>（</rp><rt></rt><rp>）</rp></ruby> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silkie">silkie</a>) breed of chicken. Then I ran into another and another!</p>

<p>Later I learned the chickens live nearby and roam the park as they please. They're someone's pets, so don't even think about eating them. I certainly didn't…</p>

<p>Not long after my silkie chicken adventure, I found another Momotarō character: the <abbr title="The Japanese word for &quot;grandmother&quot; or &quot;old woman.&quot;">obāsan</abbr>.</p>

<p>In some versions of the story, she finds the giant peach while doing laundry in the river. So next to this statue is a rock moved from the nearby Kiso river, where it's said she washed laundry every day.</p>

<p>The rock has two footprints in it because (according to legend) the <abbr title="The Japanese word for &quot;grandmother&quot; or &quot;old woman.&quot;">obāsan</abbr> was a hardcore laundry fanatic and washed her clothes <em>in the same spot for decades</em>. That's right, she wore down rock just by standing on it.</p>

<p>Was she incredibly heavy? Did she have thermal feet? Either way, she was one strong, old lady if she was able to carry a peach that size. What is that, like eleven pounds?</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="dog and monkey statues at momotaro shrine" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/dog-and-monkey.jpg" /></figure>

<p>On the way up the steps there was another dog and monkey duo. Why no pheasant this time? (Discrimination?!)</p>

<p>This dog looks kind of like the dad dog from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJcvRLKO_pU">those Softbank commercials</a>.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="monkey god who protects children" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/monkey-deity.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Then there was yet <em>another</em> monkey. But this one was different. His sign says he's the guardian deity of children. I think. I'm not really sure how the fictional universe of these statues works.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="baby momotaro jumping out of a peach" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/momotaro-peach.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Finally, at the top of the stairs, there he was, the Peach Boy himself, Momotarō! Ta-da!</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="naked baby jumping out of a peach" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/momotaro-peach-statue.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Momotarō is quite the healthy baby. As a newborn, he's already got the body of a six-year-old. Maybe that's why he was able to dispatch those <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr> as a preteen. With this head start, he probably had a Chris Evans bod at ten.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="blue and red oni carrying food" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/blue-and-red-oni.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Continuing up the stairs past the nude Peach Boy, I found two <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr>, one red and one blue, carrying down trays of food. These were some of the captured servants. Poor guys. All they wanted in life was to murder peasants and plunder riches.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="old man from momotaro story" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/ojiisan.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Up the stairs a little more, I found the <abbr title="The Japanese word for &quot;grandfather&quot; or &quot;old man.&quot;">ojīsan</abbr>, carrying some logs on his back. Just like a lot of old people in Japan, <a href="https://www.tofugu.com/japan/population-decline/">he's working way past retirement</a>.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="momotaro team" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/momotaro-and-friends.jpg" /></figure>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="the team from momotaro" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/momotaro-team.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Finally! I came to the top of the stairs and found Momotarō and his animal friends sitting triumphantly above two <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr>.</p>

<p>The naked Momotarō was like the baby Kal-El emerging from his space peach and here we get the fully formed Superman (with, I guess, Monkeyman, Pheasantman, and Krypto).</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="sign at momotaro shrine" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/sign-evidence.jpg" /></figure>

<p>This sign to the right of the red <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr> states clearly and definitively that this, and no other place, is the real and true birthplace of Momotarō.</p>

<p>Most people think that Momotarō's birthplace is in Okayama (especially people living in Okayama). But this sign changes everything. It really opened my eyes.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="torii gate shaped like peach in inuyama" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/peach-torii.jpg" /></figure>

<p>To my left was the Momotarō Shrine itself, tucked away behind a peach-shaped <abbr title="A gate found at the entrance of Shinto shrines. It marks the beginning of sacred ground.">torii</abbr> gate. This peachy <abbr title="A gate found at the entrance of Shinto shrines. It marks the beginning of sacred ground.">torii</abbr> is probably the only one of its kind in the world (unless Okayama decided to steal it).</p>

<p>More dog, monkey, and pheasant statues were standing guard here, and there was a sign on the gate that read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>桃形鳥居をくぐれば、悪は<i></i> <ruby>去る<rp>（</rp><rt>さ　</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>、病は<i></i> <ruby>居<rp>（</rp><rt>い</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>ぬ、災い<i></i> <ruby>来<rp>（</rp><rt>き</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>じ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Japanese, さる is monkey, いぬ is dog, and きじ is pheasant. So the sentence above is a <a href="https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/japanese-puns/">Japanese pun</a> using the names of Momotarō characters. Get it?</p>

<p>Translated, it means, "If you pass through this gate, your bad luck will go away, your ailments will disappear, and disasters won't come."</p>

<p>So of course, I passed through the gate.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="sign telling the story of momotaro" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/momtaro-shrine-board.jpg" /></figure>

<blockquote class="highlight-right">
  <p>After the <abbr title="The Japanese word for &quot;grandfather&quot; or &quot;old man.&quot;">ojīsan</abbr> and <abbr title="The Japanese word for &quot;grandmother&quot; or &quot;old woman.&quot;">obāsan</abbr> died, Momotarō climbed a nearby mountain and made his home there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Walking up to the shrine, I found this board explaining the adventures of Momotarō <em>after</em> his <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr>-conquering expedition and how the shrine came to be:</p>

<p>After the <abbr title="The Japanese word for &quot;grandfather&quot; or &quot;old man.&quot;">ojīsan</abbr> and <abbr title="The Japanese word for &quot;grandmother&quot; or &quot;old woman.&quot;">obāsan</abbr> died, Momotarō climbed a nearby mountain and made his home there. Over time, the mountain started looking like a peach, so people called it <i>momoyama</i> <ruby>桃山<rp>（</rp><rt></rt><rp>）</rp></ruby> and made a small shrine at the base. This Momotarō Shrine was moved from Momoyama to its current location in the fifth year of the Shōwa period (1930).</p>

<p>And there you have it. More irrefutable proof (in sign form) that Aichi Prefecture is the real home of Peach Boy.</p>

<p>Aside from these signs and statues, this shrine is a lot like other Japanese shrines. You can buy paper fortunes, called omikuji, and find out what fate has in store for you.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="monkey statue that eats omikuji" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/bad-luck-monkey.jpg" /></figure>

<p>If you get a bad fortune, you can feed it to this monkey statue outside. The sign next to him says he "eats your bad luck," so feed him those nasty fortunes and save yourself. Unfortunately, all that bad luck paper has messed up his face.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="crying red oni at momotaro shrine" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/crying-red-oni.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Near the shrine, there's a crying <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr> hidden in the rock. A sign next to him says, "I won't do bad things again. Please, look at my tears."</p>

<p>I love the weirdness of this one (or I should say, <em>extra</em> weirdness). All the other statues are arranged in such a way that you'll encounter them naturally. This one is tucked away behind the <i><abbr title="A small wooden plaque on which Shinto worshipers write prayers to gods. They are left at Shinto shrines.">ema</abbr></i> <ruby>絵馬<rp>（</rp><rt></rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>. It's like he got put in the corner for being especially bad.</p>

<p>What did this crying <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr> do that was so much worse than all the others? Whatever it is, at least he's remorseful about it.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="entrance to the momotaro museum" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/museum-entrance.jpg" /></figure>

<p>If you haven't yet had your fill of Momotarō statues (who could ever have enough?), you can check out the museum area called <i>houmotsukan</i> <ruby>宝物館<rp>（</rp><rt></rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>. It's only ¥200 (¥100 for kids), so you have no excuse. You spend more than that on UFO catchers.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="entrance to the momotaro park" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/park-entrance.jpg" /></figure>

<p>I guess you could just peek over that short wall and see everything, but then you can't get up close and personal with all those Asano Shoun sculptures. Plus you won't get to see all of the Momotarō artifacts in the museum.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="momotaro souvenirs" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/momotaro-omiyage.jpg" /></figure>

<p>In the museum yard, you can buy Momotarō <a href="../../japan/omamori-japanese-charms/index.html">omamori</a> and <abbr title="A small wooden plaque on which Shinto worshipers write prayers to gods. They are left at Shinto shrines.">ema</abbr>. I thought about getting one, but I didn't and I've regretted it ever since.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="crying blue oni at momotaro park in inuyama" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/crying-blue-oni.jpg" /></figure>

<p>As I entered the yard, I was greeted by this crying blue boy. He must be related to the red <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr> in the rock. Poor <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr>-san.</p>

<p>The animals seem pretty happy about something though. <em>Especially</em> the dog!</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="old man and old woman statues" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/ojiisan-and-obaasan.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Here's the <abbr title="The Japanese word for &quot;grandmother&quot; or &quot;old woman.&quot;">obāsan</abbr> and <abbr title="The Japanese word for &quot;grandfather&quot; or &quot;old man.&quot;">ojīsan</abbr> making something. Probably <abbr title="A sweet dumpling made of mochi and millet flour.">kibidango</abbr>, which is Momotarō's favorite food and a pivotal part of the fairy tale. Or they might be making <a href="https://www.tofugu.com/japan/mochi/">mochi</a>. There's no telling.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="smiling oni statue" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/kind-oni.jpg" /></figure>

<p>And then I came upon the best, greatest, most wonderful <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr> in the whole shrine.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="oni statue on all fours" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/oni-pair.jpg" /></figure>

<p>This guy! His name is <i>yasashii <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr></i> <ruby>やさしい鬼<rp>（</rp><rt></rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>, which means "kind <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr>." He's the only ogre with a smile on his face.</p>

<p>The sign around his neck reads, "I'm the kind <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr>. Please go ahead and ride on my back."</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="an oni butt" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/oni-butt.jpg" /></figure>

<p>I was going to hop on, but then I saw him from this angle. That <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr> butt staring at me… I couldn't do it.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="a stone dog statue" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/rock-dog.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Before I left, I found a few other non-Momotarō-related things that made me smile.</p>

<p>This little cutie was in a corner by the wall. You could consider him the Momotarō dog, but I'm pretty sure he's just a regular dog turned to stone.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="abandoned japanese toys" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/toys.jpg" /></figure>

<p>There were also some kids toys. I wasn't sure if they were there for visiting children to play with or if they were just abandoned. I think I had the one in the middle when I was three.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="pictures of momotaro with faces cut out" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/head-cutouts.jpg" /></figure>

<p>There were face-in-the-hole boards (or whatever you call them) that you can use to pretend that, just for a second, you are as brave as Momotarō.</p>

<p>I wanted to do it but I was all alone and there was no one to take my picture. I'll have to come back with the whole Tofugu team someday.</p>

<p>Just when I thought there couldn't be any more statues… there were more statues.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="momotaro carrying treasure on a cart" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/spoils.jpg" /></figure>

<p>This scene depicts Momotarō and his crew on their way home with the spoils of their adventure.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="momotaro conquering an oni" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/conquered.jpg" /></figure>

<p>There was also a scene with a conquered <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr>. So conquered that <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr> was. What did they ever do to deserve such treatment? (Besides drinking people's blood.)</p>

<p>There was something unnerving about that <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr>'s pose…</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="defeated red oni" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/conquered-oni.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Next up was the Momotarō Museum! This shrine just kept unfolding into more and more peachy delights.</p>

<p>As soon as I entered the museum I was faced, once again, with rock-solid evidence that Momotarō was from Aichi. And of course, it was printed on a sign.</p>

<p>How much more evidence do you need? I already read the other <em>two very authoritative signs!</em></p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="map of inuyama in aichi with momotaro events" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/inuyama-map.jpg" /></figure>

<blockquote class="highlight-right">
  <p>Some people might feel disappointed by this. But other, more sophisticated people can appreciate an official, city-funded museum full of knick knacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This picture illustrates <a href="http://www.yha.gr.jp/momotaro/densetu.html?utm_source=Tofugu">Inuyama City's Legend of Momotarō</a>, which basically just names different cities in the Inuyama area and what Momotarō did there.</p>

<p>These are all real places in Inuyama, so this proves Momotarō visited all of them. If you're not convinced now, you never will be.</p>

<p>As I moved further into the museum I saw display cases filled with artifacts from Momotarō's journey.</p>

<p>There was an <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr>'s iron rod (used to bludgeon), an <abbr title="A Japanese ogre or demon, characterized by curly hair, horns, and/or a spiked club.">oni</abbr> penis the dog bit off, and a photo of the peach that Momotarō jumped out of. Sadly, that last artifact only exists in photo form because an arsonist tried to burn down the shrine in 2000.</p>

<p>Besides these artifacts, the museum was… Momotarō knick knacks, figures, and… stuff. Sorry, there's no other way to put it. Some of the "stuff" isn't even Momotarō related; just random figurines of dogs and monkeys and pheasants.</p>

<p>Some people might feel disappointed by this. But other, more sophisticated people can appreciate an official, city-funded museum full of knick knacks.</p>

<p>If you're reading this, you're probably that sophisticated person.</p>

<p>In the end, the shrine was a lot of fun and weirder than I expected. It's definitely the very best Momotarō shrine in the world, hands down.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="momotaro torii" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/leaving-momotaro-shrine.jpg" /></figure>

<p>On the way back to the entrance, I noticed a sign right beneath baby Momotarō's butt that reads, "It's dangerous, so don't ride on Momotarō."</p>

<p>Why put that right beneath his butt? Did someone try this already?</p>

<p>It was the weird icing on this weird cake. If you're still not sure if you'll enjoy this shrine, you know now.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="momotaro statue butt" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/travel/2017-10-31-momotaro-shrine/momotaro-butt.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Overall, I had a blast, even though it took a long time to get to the shrine and not very long to go through.</p>

<p>Considering <a href="https://twitter.com/oimokotaro/status/793087443545108481">all the sculptures were made in the 50s and 60s</a>, I imagine this place was a bigger deal in the Shōwa period when there were no video games, smartphones, or Internetz. Kids these days can't appreciate Japanese folklore statues…</p>

<p>This shrine may be a novelty today, but I imagine a lot of kids loved coming here and seeing Asano's colorfully bizarre statues, riding the abandoned scooters, and sitting on the back of やさしい鬼.</p>

<p>Today, the shrine remains an important place for the people of Inuyama to pray for their children's health. And on May the 5th, Children's Day in Japan, the shrine hosts a Momotarō Festival. <a href="https://inuyama.gr.jp.e.jm.hp.transer.com/momotaro-fes.html?utm_source=Tofugu">The pictures online look really cute</a>, so now that I have a baby girl, I know I'll be back at this shrine again someday before she's too old to dress up as Momotarō.</p>
