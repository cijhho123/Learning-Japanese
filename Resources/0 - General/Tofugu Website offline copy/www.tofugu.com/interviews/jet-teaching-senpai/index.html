<p>As you consider <a href="../../japan/jet-program-application/index.html">applying to the JET Program</a>, a lot of questions come to mind. Once you’re <a href="../../japan/jet-program-post-arrival/index.html">living in Japan on JET</a>, there are even more questions.</p>

<p>In these situations, answers from <a href="http://usjetaa.org/">JET alumni</a> are invaluable. That's why I interviewed three former JETs, one from each type of Japanese school (elementary, junior high, and high school). Each taught five years on JET, the maximum allowed, and have recently returned. They have a wide range of experience, fresh recollection, and the perspective that comes with completing the program.</p>

<p>I asked each interviewee the same twenty-three questions. This way, you can gain insight on what JET teaching is like and ideas for handling tricky situations.</p>

<p>Let's start by learning about our interviewees.</p>

<p><strong>Elementary School, Rebecca:</strong></p>

<figure class="figure-right"><img alt="jet teaching alt rebecca" style="height: 200px;" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/interviews/2016-10-04-jet-teaching-senpai/rebecca-profile.jpg" /></figure>

<blockquote>
  <p>My name is Rebecca. I was born and raised in Portland, Oregon. I had been to Japan through my local sister city association in high school before I went on JET.</p>

  <p>I was placed in rural <a href="http://www.tofugu.com/japanese/hokkaido-dialect/">Hokkaido</a> and taught elementary school there for five years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Junior High School, Matt:</strong></p>

<figure class="figure-right"><img alt="jet teaching alt matt" style="height: 200px;" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/interviews/2016-10-04-jet-teaching-senpai/matt-profile.jpg" /></figure>

<blockquote>

  <p>I'm originally from Buffalo, New York and went to school in Toronto. I studied film and became interested in Japan after studying Japanese cinema. Since my career path was a little murky, I decided that I wanted to go abroad while I was still young. Best decision I ever made! I now work for an online education tech company in the US.</p>

  <p>I was placed in Kochi City and lived there for five years teaching junior high on JET.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>High School, Tori:</strong></p>

<figure class="figure-right"><img alt="jet teaching alt tori" style="height: 200px;" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/interviews/2016-10-04-jet-teaching-senpai/tori-profile.jpg" /></figure>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Junior High School, Matt:</strong></p>

  <p>It was a mixed bag. I had some wonderful kids and some that had some serious behavior problems. I taught in a very low income area of my city, so there were some rough schools around. It took some time for me to deal with that and figure out how to make things better. I wouldn't say my experience was normal for JET. Other JETs that taught outside the city tended to have better students. However, when you get kids one-on-one and try to talk to them on a personal level, you can definitely tell a difference. I think a lot of bad behavior was just for show, and they acted like that because they knew they could get away with it.</p>

  <p>For me, the best way to make connections with students was outside of class. Staying after school playing basketball helped a ton as well as having conversations with kids before or after class. Talking about sports, music, or really anything that shows interest in their personal lives helped a ton. It was important that the kids saw me as a regular person and not just a teacher. It took me awhile to realize this, but once I did, things improved a great deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>High School, Tori:</strong></p>

  <p>My students were well behaved, shy, kind, and afraid of making mistakes. It was hard to get them to speak aloud. This is very much the norm for academic schools.

  <p>We would start with greeting. A "Good morning, how are you?" type thing. Next we would review what the class had learned the week before and do some practice. Then we would add to that or teach a new topic, usually with flashcards and songs. Think "head, shoulders, knees, and toes" level songs.

  <p><strong>Elementary School, Rebecca:</strong></p>

  <p>When I arrived, there was next to nothing tech-wise. When I left, most schools had smart boards and computers in the classroom. Smart boards are electronic whiteboards. They hook up to the computer with a USB and then, with a projector, turn your computer into a giant touch screen. If they're not calibrated correctly, they can be a pain. If they are calibrated correctly, there are a ton of fun things to do. Some of the activities in the textbook are more fun with the smart board.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Junior High School, Matt:</strong></p>

  <p>Not too much. They had computer labs, but doing any kind of tech presentation in class was a big to-do. They would have to bring in this special projector to view pictures, which there was usually only one of in the whole school.</p>

  <p>That took a lot of organizing, so generally I just brought in flashcards and laminated them. I did a lot of one-shot teaching for certain classes, so it was tough to get into a rhythm with the teachers and spend time organizing lessons.</p>

  <p>I would often bring my laptop in for English Club and show kids videos and pictures that way if I had a small group.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Elementary School, Rebecca:</strong></p>

  <p>The students knew less English, so <a href="../../japan/jet-program-alt-team-teaching-tips/index.html">more lessons needed gestures, visuals, and translation</a>. But kids this age are way more excited about English and aren't studying for a test, so you have more freedom with your lesson topics.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Junior High School, Matt:</strong></p>

  <p>I think the toughest thing was getting kids interested. I lived in a rural prefecture, so most kids didn't see any use for learning English for their future. English class was more fun for them in elementary school when they would play games.</p>

  <p>Junior high learning was much more structured around the textbook, which wasn't interesting to a lot of the kids. The trick was learning more about them on an individual level. Learning about what they're interested in made me much more appealing to the kids. They can tell when you're putting in that effort, which makes it more likely they'll put in effort in the classroom.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>High School, Tori:</strong></p>

  <p>Teaching Japanese high schools students was awesome. Really, it was like teaching high school students in the US, just with a language barrier. The unique challenge is that the students care a lot about looking stupid or being wrong. They don't take a lot of risks in their speaking and writing.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-the-team-teaching-experience-like-for-you-what-role-did-you-take-in-the-classroom">13. What was the team teaching experience like for you? What role did you take in the classroom?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Elementary School, Rebecca:</strong></p>

  <p>I loved teaching, so I took the lead when they let me. In the lessons where we had to teach with <abbr title="Two common elementary level English textbooks in Japan.">Eigo Noto or Hi Friends</abbr>, I was usually second in command, but my <abbr title="Japanese Teacher of English. Co-teacher to the ALT.">JTE</abbr> was awesome and would let me make suggestions or change things as we went.</p>

  <p>Japanese teaching style seems to be more formal/traditional than in the US. This usually means more lecture, more note taking, and less interactive classes. It wasn't true of all of my teachers, but it was true of a lot of them, especially the junior high and high school teachers.</p>

  <p>In Western culture, we expect the speaker to be clear so the listener can understand. Japanese culture expects the listener to work out the meaning. This often means the teachers expecting students to come to them outside of class if they don't understand (some students do, many don't). It also results in very little differentiation. I haven't seen many teachers consider other ways of teaching. It's almost always lecture, (maybe an activity) and then a test. Projects are rare (maybe once a year) and are not as important.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Junior High School, Matt:</strong></p>

  <p>My experience was anywhere from being a human tape recorder to being actively involved in preparing for each lesson.</p>

  <p>It seemed to me that teachers who had done more traveling and knew about other cultures were more likely to collaborate with me. Most of my <abbr title="Japanese Teacher of English. Co-teacher to the ALT.">JTEs</abbr> spoke English very well, but their skills of executing a lesson varied greatly. The teachers who were laser-focused on teaching the plan without taking into consideration the personalities of the kids were most likely to fail. The ones who could relate to the kids had the most success. Those teachers also would go out of their way to create a unique plan for me when I was there, which was always appreciated. It was always great when they wanted me to communicate with students directly instead of having me just repeat sentences over and over again.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>High School, Tori:</strong></p>

  <p>During my first year, my schools wanted to make me as comfortable as possible, and I often felt like a guest. But by the end of that year, I was teaching daily and doing all lesson plans for the team teaching classes. I have a degree in English Education, so they verbally told me they trusted me with lesson plans. Because of this I was essentially the lead teacher at all my schools. I planned all team-taught lessons, and assigned jobs for myself, the <abbr title="Japanese Teacher of English. Co-teacher to the ALT.">JTE</abbr>, and the students during class time.</p>

  <p>The biggest thing I had to learn was to be more proactive when things weren't going well. It was easy to blame the students, the teachers, or something else. But I had to learn to put more responsibility on myself to make things better. When I got frustrated with the lesson plans, I started making more suggestions to my <abbr title="Japanese Teacher of English. Co-teacher to the ALT.">JTEs</abbr>, which definitely helped. When students misbehaved, I found out which clubs they belonged to and started spending more time with them outside the classroom.</p>

  <p>Another important thing I had to remind myself was that I didn't know what was going on with kids in their home life. When kids would misbehave, it was easy to just say that they were bad seeds. However, there was often much more to their stories when I would talk to my teachers about them.</p>

  <p><strong>Junior High School, Matt:</strong></p>

  <p>One time I was about to go on vacation for three weeks. Right before, I heard I would need to stay in town longer because of a half day elementary school seminar. To me, this was unreasonable as I had already requested that time off. It could be tough to resolve these kind of situations because they'd insist on certain things being important when they often weren't. Often you'll get the "that's just the way it is" response. When I emphasized the importance of seeing my family and spending quality time with them, they understood and allowed me to take the time off.</p>

  <p><strong>High School, Tori:</strong></p>

  <p>Once I misunderstood the time when I was supposed to be at school, and ended up showing up late. I apologized profusely and reassured my supervisor I would never let it happen again.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-most-positive-aspect-of-the-japanese-way-of-doing-school-then-give-us-the-most-negative">22. What’s the most positive aspect of the Japanese way of doing school? Then give us the most negative.</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Elementary School, Rebecca:</strong></p>

  <p>The most positive aspect is how much the teachers care about their students.</p>

  <p><a href="../../japan/japanese-schools-vs-american-schools/index.html">The most negative is how much the teachers move</a>. They get invested in a community and then suddenly have a new placement, possibly hours away.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Junior High School, Matt:</strong></p>

  <p>It was always cool seeing what students could accomplish in groups. I loved the emphasis on collaboration and creating great stuff for the school. The group mentality has its negative points, but it was always awesome seeing kids work together on a common goal. I also loved the emphasis on the arts and music in schools.</p>

  <p>I'd say the most negative is the focus on standardized testing and teaching from the textbooks. It hinders students from thinking critically and being more creative.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>High School, Tori:</strong></p>

  <p>The most positive part of Japanese school is the work ethic. The most negative is the lack of confidence kids have.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-could-go-back-in-time-to-your-past-self-before-you-started-your-jet-teaching-career-what-advice-would-you-give">23. If you could go back in time to your past self before you started your JET teaching career, what advice would you give?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Elementary School, Rebecca:</strong></p>

  <p><a href="../../japanese/japanese-fluency-make-mistakes/index.html">Don't let your lack of Japanese skills keep you from trying to meet with and communicate with people</a>. If your lack of Japanese is too much for some people, move on. But there are a ton of people in town who will try with their limited English to talk to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Junior High School, Matt:</strong></p>

  <p>Be more proactive at the outset. Don't wait for things to get better, and start making them better yourself. Whenever possible, try to be around others and initiate more conversations. It's amazing when sometimes just saying "hello" to someone can make your and their day better.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>High School, Tori:</strong></p>

  <p>Do everything exactly how you did.</p>

<p>I want to say a big thank you to Rebecca, Matt, and Tori for answering my questions about JET teaching and their experiences living in Japan. If you'd like to ask a JET alum about their experience teaching English abroad, check out <a href="http://usjetaa.org/">US JETAA</a> or <a href="http://www.jetaainternational.org/">JETAA International</a> to get connected with former JETs in your area.</p>
