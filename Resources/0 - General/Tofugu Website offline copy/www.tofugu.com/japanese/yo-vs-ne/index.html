<p>Sentence ending particles like よ (yo) and ね (ne) are a fascinating, yet challenging aspect of the Japanese language. They don't really mean anything specific, like 猫 means “cat” or 座る means “sit”, but they certainly add meaning to a sentence.</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, teachers and textbooks often describe just one function of each particle. Take よ, for example, which is often presented as a "spoken exclamation mark." While よ can indeed create a similar nuance to that of an exclamation mark in English, this comparison doesn't cover the full range of uses that よ has in Japanese. A more comprehensive description of よ is that it is used to show the information in your statement flows from you to the person you're talking to.</p>

<p>ね, on the other hand, is usually thought of as similar to a tag question in English, like "right?" or "don't you think?" However, it's more accurate to think of it as showing that the information is known or experienced by both you and the person you're talking to.</p>

<p>While these key concepts can be applied across the board, the exact flavor that よ and ね add varies somewhat depending on the context. This article will help you to understand the meaning attached to each particle, and how choosing よ or ね in a range of different situations can completely change the feeling of what you say.</p>

  <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> This article assumes you already know hiragana and katakana. If you need to brush up, have a look at our <a href="../learn-hiragana/index.html">Ultimate Hiragana Guide</a> and <a href="../learn-katakana/index.html">Ultimate Katakana Guide</a>. This article will talk about the nuances of よ and ね, so beginners can read it too, but to get the most out of it, you'll need an intermediate understanding of Japanese.</p>

<h2 id="conceptualizing--and--in-speech">Conceptualizing よ and ね In Speech</h2>

<p>So how exactly do よ and ね work? Let's take a moment to conceptualize the meaning they add to a sentence.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="The left person is speaking out a speech bubble saying よ" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2020-08-11-yo-vs-ne/concept-of-yo.jpg" /></figure>

<p>In this image of a statement ending in よ, the speech bubble is the same color as the speaker, and is sitting in the speaker's hand, showing that the information belongs to the speaker. This is because よ indicates that the person is providing new information or a new perspective, or at least that they want to give the impression that that is what they are doing. よ catches the listener's attention and adds the nuance that we are informing, or alerting, the listener of something they didn't know before.</p>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="the left person is speaking out a speech bubble saying ね" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2020-08-11-yo-vs-ne/concept-of-ne.jpg" /></figure>

<p>In this image of a ね ending statement, the speech bubble is a mixture of the color of the speaker and the listener, and they are both holding it, showing that they share the information. This is because ね is for acknowledging or confirming information with the listener. Using ね indicates that the information is not the speaker's alone, but is shared between the speaker and the listener, and the speaker imagines that the listener is on the same page. It's possible that they are not actually on the same page, but ね shows that the speaker is choosing to present it that way.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-between--and-">Choosing Between よ and ね</h2>

<p>Now that you have the basic concepts of よ and ね in hand, it's time to practice how to apply these concepts in the real world. In many contexts, you can use either particle in the same situation, depending on the nuance you want to add to your statement. In other contexts, your choice is more limited, with one particle being preferable over the other. As we move through a range of different contexts, test your understanding of よ and ね to see if you can make the most appropriate choice👌.</p>

<h3 id="informing-someone">Informing Someone</h3>

<p>Imagine that you are walking in the street and the person in front of you drops their wallet. You shout out to tell them. Which do you choose, よ or ね?</p>

<ul class="example-sentence">
  <li>財布落としました<strong>よ</strong>/<strong>ね</strong>!</li>
  <li>You dropped your wallet!</li>
</ul>

<div class="blurred-box">
<p class="blurred-text-instruction"><i class="fa fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i> EXPLANATION: Hover or tap</p>
<span class="blurred-text">In this case, よ is more suitable because it highlights that you are drawing the person's attention to something they don't know yet. If you used ね, you would sound like you're confirming the fact that the person dropped the wallet, which doesn't make sense in this context.<br />
<br />
It's worth noting that you could say the same sentence without any particle. If there's no particle, the intention is purely to state a fact, without giving any indication of your intention.
</span>
</div>

<p>If you thought the last situation was a little easy, we're about to shake things up a bit. What if you are informing someone of something they already know?</p>

<p>Imagine this — you're walking down the street with your friend on a hot summer day, looking for something to eat. As sweat drips off your nose, your friend suggests spicy hot pot. One way to indirectly reject your friend's offer is to remind him how hot it is today. Which do you choose, よ or ね?</p>

<ul class="example-sentence">
  <li>今日はすごく暑い<strong>よ</strong>/<strong>ね</strong>。</li>
  <li>It's really hot today.</li>
</ul>

<div class="blurred-box">
<p class="blurred-text-instruction"><i class="fa fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i> EXPLANATION: Hover or tap</p>
<span class="blurred-text">In this case, we suggest  よ. Remember, よ implies to your listener that what you're saying is new information or a fresh perspective. In this context, your friend probably knows it's hot out, but your choice of sentence-ending particle boils down to your feeling that your friend doesn't realize just how hot it is. <br />
<br />
You might have assumed that you can choose ね, and we can see why. The fact that it's a hot day is obviously shared between you and your friend. However, if you use ね, you are simply sharing how you feel about the weather, not answering your friend's question about hot pot.
</span>
</div>

<h3 id="giving-someone-a-compliment">Giving Someone a Compliment</h3>

<p>Let's move on to a completely different scenario — giving someone a compliment. Let's say that you just noticed your senpai's beautiful handwriting and you want to compliment her on it. Which do you choose, よ or ね?</p>

<ul class="example-sentence">
  <li>字がとても綺麗です<strong>よ</strong>/<strong>ね</strong>。</li>
  <li>Your handwriting is very neat.</li>
</ul>

<div class="blurred-box">
<p class="blurred-text-instruction"><i class="fa fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i> EXPLANATION: Hover or tap</p>
<span class="blurred-text">Since you're giving a compliment, it's probably best to use ね. This implies that the sheer beauty of your senpai's handwriting is obvious, and thus is shared information. If you used よ on the other hand, the implication would be that your senpai doesn't think her handwriting is neat. It's not impossible, but not nearly as common.
</span>
</div>

<p>Let's keep going with this conversation. As is typical in Japanese culture, your senpai might reject your compliment in order to show humility. If that happens, what would you do? Maybe you'd try to convince your senpai by repeating the compliment. This time, which would you choose, よ or ね?</p>

<ul class="example-sentence">
  <li>いやいや、綺麗です<strong>よ</strong>/<strong>ね</strong>。</li>
  <li>No really, it's very neat.</li>
</ul>

<div class="blurred-box">
<p class="blurred-text-instruction"><i class="fa fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i> EXPLANATION: Hover or tap</p>
<span class="blurred-text">This time, よ would be more suitable. Why? Your senpai has refuted your compliment, so you can't treat the beauty of her handwriting as shared information. Her humble reply means that you're not on the same page, and the idea that her handwriting is nice is information that comes from you, making よ the better choice.<br />
<br />
If you chose ね instead, you'd simply be repeating your previous statement, which could come off sounding pushy unless it's clear you're doing it deliberately for a humorous effect. Repeating a sentence word for word in English would probably have a similar effect. Switching up the particle the second time removes the feeling of repetition that can create a sense of pushiness.
</span>
</div>

<h3 id="making-suggestions-and-requests">Making Suggestions and Requests</h3>

<p>Next let's see how よ and ね work when making a suggestion. Imagine that you have a big test coming up tomorrow, and you want to offer your classmate some encouragement. Which do you choose, よ or ね?</p>

<ul class="example-sentence">
  <li>明日頑張ろう<strong>よ</strong>/<strong>ね</strong>。</li>
  <li>Let's try our best tomorrow.</li>
</ul>

<div class="blurred-box">
<p class="blurred-text-instruction"><i class="fa fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i> EXPLANATION: Hover or tap</p>
<span class="blurred-text">Choosing  ね is the more natural option, since you and your classmate are probably on the same page; that is, you agree that you both need to try your best. However, you could choose よ if you have a reason to assume your classmate is not going to try their best, and needs to be pushed to do so. The same concept applies whenever you suggest doing an activity with another person. If you say また遊ぼうよ after going on a date, you would sound like you're pushing your date to say yes. So to suggest another date, you'd usually say また遊ぼうね instead, because hopefully you're on the same page about that 😉.
</span>
</div>

<p>Let's take this exploration of making suggestions a step further. Let's say that you and your classmate decide to study together for this big test, but it starts getting late so you suggest taking a break for dinner. Which do you choose, よ or ね?</p>

<ul class="example-sentence">
  <li>なにか食べよう<strong>よ</strong>/<strong>ね</strong>。</li>
  <li>Let's get something to eat.</li>
</ul>

<div class="blurred-box">
<p class="blurred-text-instruction"><i class="fa fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i> EXPLANATION: Hover or tap</p>
<span class="blurred-text">Stumped? That's to be expected, this was sort of a trick question! The most natural way to make this suggestion would be in the form of a question, such as なにか食べない？ or なにか食べようか？<br />
<br />
Still, let's explore the nuances that both よ and ね can add to the example sentence. Remember how よ can sound pushy when making a suggestion? Well it does here too. It suggests that what you have to say is new information, but a suggestion is, by nature, new information. So adding よ marks this twice, making it sound a little pushy, or like a child demanding what they want. <br />
<br />
What about ね? You'll hear this language choice when parents are talking to their children. Using ね implies that the information is shared between the speaker and listener, so when making a suggestion, it sounds as though the speaker knows what's best for the listener. When using ね to suggest a specific action or task, it comes across as something of a soft command.
</span>
</div>

<p>Next, let's turn our attention to the nuances of よ and ね when making requests.</p>

<p>Imagine you're talking to your spouse just as they are leaving for work. It's your child's birthday, so you want your spouse to come back home early. In this case, which particle would you use and why? If you can give good reasoning behind your choice of よ and ね, it means you are getting the handle of the basic concept of these particles.</p>

<ul class="example-sentence">
  <li>できるだけ早く帰ってきて<strong>よ</strong>/<strong>ね</strong>。</li>
  <li>Come home as early as possible.</li>
</ul>

<div class="blurred-box">
<p class="blurred-text-instruction"><i class="fa fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i> EXPLANATION: Hover or tap</p>
<span class="blurred-text">Oops, another trick question! In fact, both よ and ね are okay here. So, how do they change the sound of your speech, without necessarily changing the meaning?<br />
<br />
The first sentence with よ sounds more pushy and therefore might have nagging overtones. This is because よ implies an assumption that your spouse doesn't share your perspective (regardless of whether or not they actually do).<br />
<br />
The sentence that ends in ね sounds softer and has the “please” feeling because ね indicates your expectation that your spouse and you are on the same page, or they agree with you. This makes you sound less forceful when compared to using よ.
</span>
</div>

<h3 id="in-formal-settings">In Formal Settings</h3>

<p>We've covered a wide range of contexts, but what about when formality comes into the mix?</p>

<p>Here's the scene — you're just finishing up a company dinner, and your boss asks you how much their share of the check comes to. You could respond in any of the following ways:</p>

<ul class="example-sentence">
  <li>一万円です<strong>よ</strong>。<br />
一万円です<strong>ね</strong>。<br />
一万円です。</li>
  <li>It's 10,000 yen.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the nuance and level of formality changes depending on your particle choice. How do you think they differ? Once you've had a chance to think about them, hover or tap the blurred text below to reveal our analysis and compare it with your own.</p>

<div class="blurred-box">
<p class="blurred-text-instruction"><i class="fa fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i> EXPLANATION: Hover or tap</p>
<span class="blurred-text">If someone asks you a question, it's a safe bet that it's because they don't have the answer. If you know the answer, logic dictates that よ is the most suitable option for your reply.  However, using よ calls attention to the fact that you are providing new information your boss needs. When you're answering a question asked by your superior, you are expected to be concise and straightforward. Thus, using よcan be inappropriate in this context, unless you are close enough with your boss to be casual.<br />
<br />
What about ね? ね adds a feeling of togetherness and makes you sound like you're confirming the information with your boss. However, your boss has asked you to simply provide the information, rather than confirm it with him, so the use of ね is unnecessary and adds a casual feel to your response. You might hear people say this, but it's considered less polite than our final option, 一万円です.<br />
<br />
When you don't use any particle, you're passing on the information as is. Thus, 一万円です sounds neutral and is probably the safest option if you want to keep things formal. In very formal contexts in Japanese, there is an expectation that information will be given in the most straightforward, neutral way possible. This is especially so when responding to someone of a higher status than you.<br />
<br />
ですよ and ですね are still possible if you and your boss are on very close and friendly terms, though. They are also chosen sometimes when workers talk to customers in a friendly manner. Ultimately, it all comes down to the impression that you want to create.
</span>

<h2 id="combining--and-">Combining よ and ね</h2>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="a person is asking about potatochips with よね" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2020-08-11-yo-vs-ne/final-particle-yone.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Now that you're getting the hang of choosing between よ and ね, here comes a curveball — you can also combine よ and ね into よね (but never ねよ, you weirdo 🙃). よね is nice and simple because it is basically a hybrid of よ and ね. The よ suggests you are providing new information, but the ね adds the nuance that you are probably also on the same page, so the meaning is somewhere between the two.</p>

<p>Let's examine how this works in action. First, imagine you and your roommate are going to have a movie night. You always eat potato chips on movie nights, so you open the cupboard to grab some but they're not there. You're pretty sure that your roomie bought a new bag of potato chips yesterday when she went to the store. To double check, you ask:</p>

<ul class="example-sentence">
  <li>昨日ポテトチップス買った<strong>よね</strong>？</li>
  <li>You bought potato chips yesterday, right?</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you tell why よね is the best choice, not よ or ね? Take a moment to think about your answer, then see the explanation below.</p>

<div class="blurred-box">
<p class="blurred-text-instruction"><i class="fa fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i> EXPLANATION: Hover or tap</p>
<span class="blurred-text">Since よ implies that you are providing new information to your listener, 昨日ポテトチップス買ったよ would be more suitable if you wanted to let your roomie know you bought potato chips. You might say this to stop your roommate from buying another bag next time they're at the supermarket.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, ね indicates your high expectation that your roommate already knows what you're saying, and you're simply confirming. So, saying 昨日ポテトチップス買ったね？sounds like you are confirming what your roommate did, as parents might do with their children. This creates a nuance of authority and has a nurturing feel to it. Alternatively, it might sound like you are passive aggressively complaining about your roommate buying the potato chips by forcing her to admit it.<br />
<br />
How about よね? It implies that you think your roommate knows whether or not she bought potato chips, but leaves the space to say no. So, it's the best option for double checking whether those darn potato chips were bought or not.
</span>
</div>

<p>Just to really nail it down, let's examine one final context. You're talking to your coworker about a friend of yours from high school. He has the amazing ability to put udon noodles in his nose and pull them out of his mouth. To wrap up your story, you say to your coworker, “Anyways, he is very silly, isn't he?". In this case, it's more natural to use the hybrid よね, as in おもしろいよね, rather than just よ, ね or no particle. Take time to think why and then see the explanation below.</p>

<ul class="example-sentence">
  <li>おもしろい<strong>よね</strong>？</li>
  <li>He is very silly, isn't he?</li>
</ul>

<div class="blurred-box">
<p class="blurred-text-instruction"><i class="fa fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i> EXPLANATION: Hover or tap</p>
<span class="blurred-text">よ implies that you are telling something new to your coworker. So, it works if you say that to preface the story like "Do you want to hear my friend's storry? It's おもしろいよ!”  but it doesn't work to wrap up the story, since the new information (your story) has already been delivered.<br />
<br />
ね indicates that the information is not the speaker's alone but shared between the speaker and the listener. The story is already shared, so it seems possible to say おもしろいね. However, this choice comes across as slightly unnatural, because it suggests that you know your coworker finds the story funny for sure. If it was their story, sure, but since you told it, it's quite presumptuous to assume they found it as hilarious as you do.<br />
<br />
So that leaves us with よね. Its hybrid function allows you to demonstrate your expectation that your coworker agrees that the story was funny using ね, while よ highlights that this new perspective comes from you, leaving room for them to disagree.
</span>
</div>

<h2 id="section">分かったよね？</h2>

<p>We've reached the end of the line with our exploration of よ and ね. Hopefully these scenarios have given you a better feel for how these two particles work.</p>

<p>To sum it up, よ emphasizes the information gap between you and your listener, while ね creates the feeling of sharing the information. よね is in between and is often used to double check something.</p>

<p>Obviously we didn't cover every possible situation using よ and ね, so the chances are you'll encounter new usages of よ and ね in real life. However, now you've got the basic concepts of よ and ね in your toolbox, you'll hopefully be able to analyze those sentences for yourself.</p>
