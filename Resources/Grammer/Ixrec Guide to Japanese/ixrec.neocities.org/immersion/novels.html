                            Keiko Furukura is a 36-year-old woman who has been working part-time at a convenience store,
                            or konbini, for the last 18 years. She has known since childhood that she is "different" and
                            that expressing her own views and actions is inexplicable and distressing to others, and
                            causes problems. The highly regulated world of the konbini, where each action is prescribed
                            by the corporate manual, allows her to maintain an identity acceptable to those around her
                            and a sense of purpose.

                            next door. They have almost never spoken despite being in the same class—until the day he

                            The novel is a nostalgic story of loss and burgeoning sexuality. It is told from the
                            first-person perspective of Toru Watanabe, who looks back on his days as a college student
                            living in Tokyo. Through Watanabe's reminiscences, readers see him develop relationships
                            with two very different women—the beautiful yet emotionally troubled Naoko, and the
                            outgoing, lively Midori.

                            The year is 2095. Magic has been tamed as another form of technology, and the practice of
                            magic is now a rigorous discipline. Brother and sister Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba are just
                            about to start their first year at the renowned First Magic High School of Japan. But the
                            school's ironclad rules mean that the brilliant Miyuki enters the prestigious Course 1,
                            while her older brother, Tatsuya, is relegated to Course 2—and that's just the beginning of
                            their troubles!

                            A Fool's Life is an autobiographical collection of reminiscences, observations, and ideas
                            about a man on the edge. There are fifty-one pieces, ranging from proper anecdotes to
                            incomplete sketches and observations. Again, autobiography is central, with much addressing
                            situations that Akutagawa himself faced -- revealing also how much of this weighed on him.
