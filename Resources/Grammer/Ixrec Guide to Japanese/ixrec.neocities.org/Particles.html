<h1 align=left style='font-size:18.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:left;text-indent:0in'>Grammar Part 1: Particles</h1>

<p>In English, you generally rely on word order to determine what each word is doing in the sentence.  In Japanese, while there are rules for word order, only a handful of verb-related rules are actually mandatory (they're explained in <a href="Clauses.html">Grammar Part 3: Clauses</a>).  The optional rules can be summed up by the fact that Japanese sentences default to SOV (subject, object, verb) order. English enforces an SVO (subject, verb, object) order on all of its sentences. For instance, in English we say "I bought flowers", but in Japanese you would <i>normally</i> put "flowers" in front of "bought", though other arrangements are also valid.</p>

<p>Instead of word order, Japanese relies on its particles to tell you what each word is doing.  It is impossible to define these particles in terms of any single English word or concept, so I need to use some basic grammatical terms to explain them. If you aren't confident you know what terms like "subject", "object", "inflection", "conjugation", "stem", "tense" and of course "particle" mean, go read the <a href="GT.html">Grammar Terminology</a> page now.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I divide Japanese particles into four categories: simple case markers, sentence ending particles, compound particles, and grammatical vocabulary.  That last category is made up of words which may or may not be considered particles, so I'm saving it for the next page.</p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><u>Simple Case Markers</u></span></p>

<p> </p>

<p>“case marker” is the term for a word that denotes the grammatical role of another word (in Japanese they are all postpositions, meaning they denote the role of the previous word or phrase).  Case markers are the core of all Japanese grammar, and you should spend the vast majority of your time trying to master them.  As a result, I'll cover each one individually, after quickly showing you a list with all of them.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>When explaining them individually, I will use example sentences simple enough that you should be able to work them out just by looking up some words and reading what I wrote around them. However, I will also omit some details and even entire meanings which neither can nor should be explained at this stage, instead leaving links to places in the guide where they are explained.</p>

<p> </p>

<a name="list"></a>
<p><u>List of Simple Case Markers</u></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span lang="ja">は</span> (wa) indicates the subject, or the context</p>
<p><span lang="ja">が</span> indicates the subject, the object in certain cases, or just means “but”</p>
<p><span lang="ja">も</span> indicates a subject and implies the existence of another subject</p>
<p><span lang="ja">を</span> (o) indicates an object</p>
<p><span lang="ja">と</span> can mean “and,” “with,” “if,” or mark any object which can be interpreted as a quotation</p>
<p><span lang="ja">の</span> indicates possession, means “of” (except backwards), or links adjectives to nouns</p>
<p><span lang="ja">へ</span> (e) indicates the goal, destination or direction of an action</p>
<p><span lang="ja">で</span> indicates either the means by which or the situation in which an action is performed</p>
<p><span lang="ja">な</span> marks an adjective or changes a noun into an adjective</p>
<p><span lang="ja">に</span> changes a noun to an adverb, or indicates location, or indicates an animate or optional object</p>
<p><span lang="ja">って</span> indicates a quotation, or informally a subject/context<br>
<br>
</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
<a name="wa"></a>
<p><u><span lang="ja">は</span> wa</u></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span lang="ja">は</span> is normally pronounced "ha", but it changes to "wa" when used as a particle. Don't worry, it's the only kana that ever does this.</p>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>1) denotes the subject of the clause</p>
</dt>

<p> </p>

<dd>
<p>This should be easy to understand even if it's hard to get used to. To say it a bit more intuitively: <span lang="ja">は</span> wa comes immediately after whatever is performing the action.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>
<table><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">学校は楽しい</span></td> <td>School is fun.</td> <td><span lang="ja">学校</span> "School" is the subject</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">馬は跳んだ</span></td> <td>The horse jumped.</td> <td><span lang="ja">馬</span> "The horse" is the subject</td>
</tr></table>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you tried to learn Japanese through watching anime, you may have convinced yourself that <span lang="ja">は</span> means "is". It does not. In fact the first sentence has no verb at all, which is perfectly fine in Japanese.</p>
</dd>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>2) denotes the context in which the main clause occurs</p>
</dt>

<p> </p>

<dd>
<p>This sounds odd at first, but it's surprisingly easy to understand in examples.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>
<table><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">昨日はみんなが欠席だった</span></td> <td>Yesterday, everyone was absent.</td> <td><span lang="ja">昨日</span> "Yesterday" is the context within which "everyone was absent".</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">俺は蛇が怖い</span></td> <td>For me, snakes are scary.</td> <td><span lang="ja">俺</span> "me" is the context within which "snakes are scary".</td>
</tr></table>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>With simple sentences like this, it's possible to treat these as special cases and not as a true alternate meaning of <span lang="ja">は</span> wa. But there are more complex sentences where you need to see this as a genuine alternate meaning.</p>
</dd>

<p> </p>
</dl>

<dl>
<a name="ga"></a>
<p><u><span lang="ja">が</span> ga</u></p>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>1) denotes the subject</p>
</dt>

<p> </p>

<dd>
<p>This meaning is shared with <span lang="ja">は</span> wa. Usually, when denoting a subject, <span lang="ja">は</span> wa and <span lang="ja">が</span> ga are technically interchangeable.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>
<table><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">学校が楽しい</span></td> <td>School is fun.</td> <td><span lang="ja">学校</span> "School" is the subject</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">馬が跳んだ</span></td> <td>The horse jumped.</td> <td><span lang="ja">馬</span> "The horse" is the subject</td>
</tr></table>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A lot of the time either <span lang="ja">は</span> wa or <span lang="ja">が</span> ga will be a more natural choice (either due to convention or to prevent <a href="Clauses.html#ambgcont">clause break ambiguity</a>), but that is not something you should be worrying about at this stage. It's much better to learn it through experience anyway.</p>
</dd>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>2) can denote an object if it is inanimate or the object of an emotion</p>
</dt>

<p> </p>

<dd>
<p>This is much more likely to be an issue with simple sentences, but it's also a lot less common than the first meaning, so don't worry too much about it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>
<table><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">成績がもらった</span></td> <td>I received my grades.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">野菜が嫌い</span></td> <td>I hate vegetables.</td>
</tr></table>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>My theory is, <span lang="ja">が</span> ga can denote an object if either: the object is inanimate and thus incapable of performing the action in question (grades can't receive, vegetables can't hate), or it's the object of an emotion. The latter is a genuinely special case, since it seems to apply to only a small handful of emotional words like <span lang="ja">好き</span> suki (like/love), <span lang="ja">嫌い</span> kirai (dislike/hate), <span lang="ja">怖い</span> kowai (afraid), which already have some <a href="CV.html#sukikirai">odd grammatical behavior</a>, so don't let this worry you.</p>
</dd>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>3) can simply mean “but”</p>
</dt>

<p> </p>

<dd>
<p>
<table><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">宿題はいいが、テストが難しすぎる</span></td> <td>The homework is fine, but the tests are too hard.</td>
</tr></table>
</p>
</dd>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>4) used to make a certain conditional verb form</p>
</dt>

<p> </p>

<dd>
<p>Will be explained <a href="Conjugation.html#misc">later</a>.</p>
</dd>

<p> </p>
</dl>

<dl>
<a name="mo"></a>
<p><u><span lang="ja">も</span> mo</u></p>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>1) denotes one of multiple subjects (the others may be implied)</p>
</dt>

<p> </p>

<dd>
<p>
<table><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">学校も楽しい</span></td> <td>School is also fun.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">馬も跳んだ</span></td> <td>The horse also jumped.</td>
</tr></table>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This should be pretty easy.</p>
</dd>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>2) changes interrogative pronouns into indefinite or negative pronouns</p>
</dt>

<p> </p>

<dd>
<p>  Virtually every case of this is listed somewhere later in the guide, such as <a href="Vocab.html#pronouns">List of Pronouns</a> or <a href="Conjugation.html#teforms">-te Forms</a>, so you don't have to worry about it.</p>
</dd>

<p> </p>
</dl>

<dl>
<a name="wo"></a>
<p><u><span lang="ja">を</span> wo</u></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span lang="ja">を</span> wo is often pronounced closer to "o" than "wo", and may be romanized as just "o", though I don't consider this a serious pronunciation change.</p>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>1) denotes the object of the clause</p>
</dt>

<p> </p>

<dd>
<p>This should also be easy to understand: <span lang="ja">を</span> wo comes immediately after whatever is being acted upon.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>
<table><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">リスが栗を拾った</span></td> <td>The squirrel picked up a chestnut.</td> <td><span lang="ja">栗</span> "a chestnut" is the object</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">私は帽子を被る</span></td> <td>I'll wear a hat.</td> <td><span lang="ja">帽子</span> "a hat" is the object</td>
</tr></table>
</p>
</dd>

<p> </p>

<p>Since this particle has no other meanings or uses, it should be one of the easiest to learn. On the other hand, several other particles are capable of denoting objects, so don't get complacent with this one.</p>

<p> </p>
</dl>

<dl>
<a name="to"></a>
<p><u><span lang="ja">と</span> to</u></p>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>1) denotes an object which can be interpreted as a quote, often before a verb such as <span lang="ja">言う</span> (say) or <span lang="ja">思う</span> (think)</p>
</dt>

<p> </p>

<dd>
<p>
<table><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">俺は一ヶ月が必要と思う</span></td> <td>I think one month is needed.<br>I think that "One month is needed".</td> <td>The quote/thought "One month is needed" is the object.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">彼女がはいと言ったか</span>？</td> <td>Did she say yes?<br>Did she say "yes"?</td> <td>The quote "yes" is the object.</td>
</tr></table>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Basically, there's a handful of verbs that love to use <span lang="ja">と</span> to for denoting their objects instead of <span lang="ja">を</span> wo, and about a year ago it finally hit me that objects for those verbs can almost always be interpreted as quotations. This includes onomatopoeias, which Japanese has loads of.</p>
</dd>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>2) denotes one of multiple subjects that performed a single action together; often means “with”</p>
</dt>

<p> </p>

<dd>
<p>
<table><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">あいつと勝負した</span></td> <td>I fought with him.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">みんなと行きました</span></td> <td>I went with everyone.</td>
</tr></table>
</p>
</dd>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>3) simply means “if” or “when” after verbs</p>
</dt>

<p> </p>

<dd>
<p>
<table><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">終わると、夜明けでした</span></td> <td>When I finished, it was dawn.</td>

<td><span lang="ja">今行くと死ぬぞ</span></td> <td>If you go now you'll die.</td>
</tr></table>
</p>
</dd>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>4) can simply mean “and” between two short nouns or adjectives</p>
</dt>

<p> </p>

<dd>
<p>
<table><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">彼女と私は協力しています</span></td> <td>She and I are working together.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">教科書とノートを持ってきた</span></td> <td>I brought my textbook and notebook.</td>
</tr></table>
</p>
</dd>

</dd>

<p> </p>
</dl>

<dl>
<a name="no"></a>
<p><u><span lang="ja">の</span> no</u></p>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>1) means “of,” except backward compared to English, and is used more broadly</p>
</dt>

<p> </p>

<dd>
<p>
<table><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">これは愛の物語</span></td> <td>This is a story of love.</td> <td>"<span lang="ja">愛</span> (love) <span lang="ja">の</span> <span lang="ja">物語</span> (story)" becomes "story of love"</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">赤のチームは負けた</span></td> <td>The team of red lost. or The red team lost.</td> <td>"<span lang="ja">赤</span> (red) <span lang="ja">の</span> <span lang="ja">チーム</span> (team)" becomes "team of red" or "red team"</td>
</tr></table>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This is another one of those things that's easy to understand but hard to get used to. By "more broadly", I meant that <span lang="ja">の</span> no is used even in sentences like the second example where the use of "of" is considered incorrect in English.</p>
</dd>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>2) denotes possession</p>
</dt>

<p> </p>

<dd>
<p>
<table><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">近所のガーデンは森だ</span></td> <td>The neighbor's garden is a forest.</td> <td>"<span lang="ja">近所</span> (neighbor) <span lang="ja">の</span>" becomes "neighbor's"</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">俺のコンピューターは早い</span></td> <td>My computer is fast.</td> <td>"<span lang="ja">俺</span> (I/me) <span lang="ja">の</span>" becomes "my"</td>
</tr></table>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This is even easier than in English, since you don't have to memorize a set of possessive pronouns like "my", "his", "her", and "theirs". Arguably this is a special case of the first meaning ("garden of neighbor" becomes "neighbor's garden", "computer of me" becomes "my computer").</p>
</dd>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>3) in compound particles, may be short for a clause-ending noun</p>

</dd>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>4) connects nouns to adjectives in a noun phrase used as an interjection</p>
</dt>

<p> </p>

<dd>
<p>This is a special case you shouldn't spend much time on. In English, it's common to exclaim things like "You idiot!" or "That bastard!", even though those are neither sentences nor interjections. Specifically, noun phrases can be used like interjections. You can do exactly the same things in Japanese, as long as you put <span lang="ja">の</span> no in between: "<span lang="ja">君のバカ！</span>" or "<span lang="ja">あいつの野郎！</span>"</p>
</dd>

<p> </p>
</dl>

<dl>
<a name="he"></a>
<p><u><span lang="ja">へ</span> he</u></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span lang="ja">へ</span> he is often pronounced closer to "e" than "he", and may be romanized as just "e", though I don't consider this a serious pronunciation change.</p>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>1) denotes a direction or destination of literal or figurative travel</p>
</dt>

<p> </p>

<dd>
<p>
<table><tr>
<td><span lang="ja">東へ行きます</span></td> <td>I'll go east.</td> <td>"<span lang="ja">東</span> (east)" is the literal direction</td>
</tr><tr>

</tr></table>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Also pretty easy, although the compound particles using <span lang="ja">へ</span> he are so similar in meaning that they often get used more than <span lang="ja">へ</span> he itself.</p>
</dd>

<p> </p>

<p>This use of <span lang="ja">で</span> de often corresponds to English prepositions such as "with" and "in".<br>Notice that the use of "with" I'm referring to here is distinct from the use of "with" that <span lang="ja">と</span> can correspond to.</p>
</dd>

<p> </p>

<dt>
<p>3) can simply be a transition, meaning “so” (causal) or “then” (temporal)</p>
</dt>

<p> </p>

<p><u>Overlaps</u></p>

<p> </p>

<p>As you probably noticed, these basic particles often overlap in meaning. So I've rearranged some of the information down here to help minimize confusion.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Particles that can denote a subject:<br>
<span lang="ja">は</span> wa and <span lang="ja">が</span> ga are the defaults for this, and should be treated as interchangeable until you have enough experience to know when one or the other is more natural<br>
<span lang="ja">も</span> mo strongly implies the existence of another subject<br>
<span lang="ja">って</span> tte is an extremely colloquial way of doing it<br>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Particles that can denote an object:<br>
<span lang="ja">を</span> wo is the default for this<br>
<span lang="ja">と</span> to denotes an object which can be interpreted as a quotation<br>
<span lang="ja">に</span> ni denotes either an animate object, or an optional/indirect object<br>
<span lang="ja">が</span> ga does this only as special cases: 1) if the noun is inanimate and can't be the subject 2) if the noun is the object of an emotion (only comes up around a small number of specific words like <span lang="ja">好き</span>, <span lang="ja">嫌い</span> and <span lang="ja">怖い</span>)<br>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>There is also some minor overlap between <span lang="ja">へ</span> he and <span lang="ja">に</span> ni when marking locations. <span lang="ja">店へ行く</span> is more like "I'll head for/go toward the store" while <span lang="ja">店に行く</span> is more like "I'll go to the store". The latter assumes that the destination will be reached and that the journey there is irrelevant.
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>There is also some minor overlap between <span lang="ja">の</span> no and <span lang="ja">な</span> na when marking adjectives. There's no rule of thumb I can give here, since the overlap arises largely because the English and Japanese languages disagree about which words/concepts should be given noun or adjective status.
</p>

<p> </p>

<a name="gobi"></a>
<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><u>Sentence Ending Particles or <span lang="ja">語尾</span> gobi</u></span></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Every Japanese clause ends with a verb (though it may be implied), and possibly one or more of a special set of particles called <span lang="ja">語尾</span> gobi meant to go immediately after said verbs.  Believe it or not, many of these you can actually ignore without changing the meaning of the sentence, so don't obsess over exactly what they mean.  An italicized m or f indicates a gobi which is particularly masculine or feminine.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span lang="ja">か</span> marks a question (more advanced uses <a href="Clauses.html#ka">later</a>)</p>
<p><span lang="ja">だ</span> or <span lang="ja">よ</span> simply mark the end of a sentence or add a little emphasis</p>
<p><span lang="ja">です</span> is like <span lang="ja">だ</span> but somewhat more formal, while <span lang="ja">っす</span> (<i>m</i>) is somewhat less formal</p>
<p><span lang="ja">ぞ</span> (<i>m</i>) or <span lang="ja">ぜ</span> (<i>m</i>) are very masculine particles expressing eagerness or excitement</p>
<p><span lang="ja">さ</span> (<i>m</i>) or <span lang="ja">な</span> place some emphasis on the descriptive words in the clause</p>
<p><span lang="ja">ね</span> (<i>f</i>) is like <span lang="ja">さ</span> or <span lang="ja">な</span> but may also ask a question or imply a response of some sort is desired</p>
<p><span lang="ja">だろう</span> (<i>m</i>) and <span lang="ja">でしょ</span> (<i>f</i>) are like <span lang="ja">ね</span> but may also mean something is likely to be the case</p>
<p><span lang="ja">の</span> (<i>f</i>) and <span lang="ja">わ</span> (<i>f</i>) are like <span lang="ja">ね</span> except they may be used solely for aesthetic reasons</p>
<p><span lang="ja">ん</span> is also aesthetic, but is only used between the verb and some other particle</p>
<p><span lang="ja">じゃない</span> often means “not,” but at the end of a sentence can mark a negative rhetorical question</p>
<p><span lang="ja">っけ</span> is a somewhat uncommon combination of <span lang="ja">って</span> and <span lang="ja">か</span> often meaning “did/didn't you say _?”</p>
<p><span lang="ja">ってば</span> is an emphatic form of <span lang="ja">って</span> often equivalent to “I'm telling you _”</p>
<p><span lang="ja">ん</span> is sometimes used to smooth the transition between the end of a verb and the gobi following it, e.g. <span lang="ja">思い出すんだ</span>. Occassionally, an <span lang="ja">ん</span> can even replace the <span lang="ja">る</span> at the end of an unconjugated verb.</p>

<p>I'll be using the "BDT format" below for dissecting all the example sentences in this guide. It's also the same format used in the pages of dissected source material. Click on the B, D and T to see a Breakdown of each sentence into words and particles, Definitions of every word and particle, and finally a Translation.
<br>
<br>If the dissection has to refer to something this guide hasn't discussed yet (like verb forms), I will gray it out so you know not to worry about it yet. In the Breakdown subsection, the color codes are as follows: <font color='blue'>nouns and pronouns</font>, <font color='green'>verbs</font>, <font color='orange'>adjectives and adverbs</font>, <font color='red'>particles</font>, <font color='purple'>gobi</font>, other.

<p>Hopefully it is now obvious why I say “thinking in Japanese” is very different from “thinking in English.”  Also keep in mind that several of these examples could be translated other ways depending on the context, especially when it comes to plurality, implied subjects and general manner of speaking.</p>

<a name="compound"></a>
<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><u>Compound Particles</u></span></p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you really understand the basic particles, then several of these can be partly or even wholly understood just by combining the meanings of two particles.  However, several of them need to be explained since it's not always obvious how to combine the meanings and they've drifted away from their most literal interpretation.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span lang="ja">には</span> indicates a location and a subject/context at the same time (if location is figurative, “in the case of _”)</p>

<p><span lang="ja">にも</span> indicates a location and an additional subject at the same time (“also in the case of _”)</p>

<p><span lang="ja">とは</span> indicates a quote-like object and a subject/context at the same time</p>

<p><span lang="ja">とか</span> most literally “and ?,” meaning “_ and similar things,” “_ and such,” or “etc”</p>

<p><span lang="ja">との</span> combines the "with" and "of" meanings to do something like "a [noun] with [noun]", e.g. <span lang="ja">彼女との再開</span> = "a reunion with her"</p>

<p><span lang="ja">のは</span> can indicate an entire clause as the subject/context, or mean “that which is _” or “the fact that _”</p>

<p><span lang="ja">のが</span> same as <span lang="ja">のは</span> but more likely to mean “that which is _”</p>

<p><span lang="ja">のに</span> same as <span lang="ja">のは</span> but with an additional “despite” or “even though” nuance</p>

<p><span lang="ja">のを</span> is just short for <span lang="ja">ものを</span> or “things [object]”</p>

<p><span lang="ja">なの</span> refers to anything which can be described by whatever precedes it; “things which are _”</p>

<p><span lang="ja">での</span> describes a subset or specific instance of something; e.g. “the _ which _ at/with _”</p>

<p><span lang="ja">では</span> indicates a situation and context at the same time; often used as a transition like "in that case"</p>

<p><span lang="ja">へと</span> is a lot like <span lang="ja">へ</span>, but has a stronger emphasis on the destination than the journey</p>

<p><span lang="ja">への</span> describes a directed subset or specific instance of something;“the _ which _ toward _”. For example, <span lang="ja">知事への怒り</span> = "the anger directed at the governor".</p>

<p><span lang="ja">だって</span> sometimes just denotes a quote with a <span lang="ja">だ</span> at the end, but can also act like <span lang="ja">も</span>, <span lang="ja">まで</span> or <span lang="ja">でも</span> with a bit more emphasis</p>

<p><span lang="ja">だっけ</span> is probably just short for <span lang="ja">だってか</span>, but like <span lang="ja">っけ</span> itself may also mean“was that what it was/called?”</p>

<p><span lang="ja">なんて</span> and <span lang="ja">なんか</span> are sometimes like <span lang="ja">だって</span>, sometimes like <span lang="ja">のが</span> and sometimes like <span lang="ja">とか</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Example sentences using these compound particles can be found at the end of the next page.</p>

<p>I exclude most combinations of gobi from this category because they don't have any special grammatical meaning.  Though they often have gender or formality connotations, those never affect intent or meaning so you can just learn them gradually through experience.</p>
