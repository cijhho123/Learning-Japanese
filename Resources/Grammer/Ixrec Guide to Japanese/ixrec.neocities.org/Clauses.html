                For many this material will be especially tricky, since the rules I can give are not as rigorous or as
                thorough as before. In fact most of the page is spent listing special cases. We're getting to the point
                where you really do have to "think in Japanese" to get this stuff.

            <p></p>

            <p>
                The quintessential rule in complex Japanese grammar (in my opinion) is that a verb always ends a clause.
                This usually also means it ends the sentence (especially if sentence ending particles come after it),
                unless:
            </p>

            <p>
                1) the verb is conjugated to some connective form (-te, -i, -eba, -nakereba, -nai to, nara, -tara, etc)
            </p>

            <p>2) the verb is immediately followed by a compound particle or quote-marking particle</p>

            <p>3) the verb is immediately followed by a noun phrase</p>

            <p>
                Case 1 was thoroughly dealt with by the last page (<a href="Conjugation.html"
                    >Grammar Part 2: Conjugation</a
                >), while case 2 was largely handled by <a href="Particles.html">Grammar Part 1: Particles</a> and the
                examples in Essential Vocabulary which use compound particles. Most of this page is about the
                potentially confusing case 3 (and how 2 is sometimes a special case of 3).
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                Long story short: if the verb at the end of a clause is immediately followed by a noun phrase, then the
                clause is describing the noun somehow.
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                Most likely, the clause is simply an action performed by said noun. A literal translation in these
                instances will often use a relative pronoun (e.g. "who"/"which"/"that"). For these first examples, I'll
                put subordinate clauses inside parenthesis for clarity.
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                <span lang="ja">犯罪者を捕まった警察者がメダルを貰った</span><br />
                (criminal [object] to capture/arrest(past)) police officer [subject] medal [object] to receive(past)<br />
                The police officer (who caught the criminal) received a medal.<br />
                <br />
                <span lang="ja">疲れた俺がもう動き出してる電車を追えない</span><br />
                (to get tired(past)) I [subject] (already to start to move(-teru)) train [object] to
                chase(potential(negative))<br />
                I (who was tired) cannot chase the train (which is already starting to move).<br />
                <br />
                <span lang="ja">まだ真空管を使ってる古いコンピュターはもういらない</span><br />
                still vacuum tube [object] to use(-teru) old computer [subject] to need(negative)<br />
                I no longer need an old computer (which is still using vacuum tubes).<br />
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                The only restriction on what verb forms can be used at the end of a subordinate clause is that the
                clause must not end in one of the aforementioned “connective forms.” That means it'll usually be
                infinitive, past, ‾te iru or ‾te ita form.
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                And keep in mind that, if it makes no sense for the noun to be performing the action, then the clause is
                describing it some other way. For example, the clause may be an action that is to be performed using the
                noun, or an ability of the noun, or even something the noun causes (more precisely, this means the
                causative/potential/passive forms can all be implied on top of the usual subject/object implication).
                However, this is quite rare. By the time you have to worry about it, it'll come to you naturally anyway.
            </p>

                So, a guide can't help teach you every way a noun phrase can be modified by a subordinate clause.
                However, it can list and explain all of the nouns which do unique things when used under such a clause.
                A
                <b>clause-ending noun</b> is my term for nouns which have special meanings or uses when they end
                clauses, separate from what they would mean anywhere else in the sentence. Many of the ones I list below
                will have definitions both as ordinary and clause-ending nouns, so try not to get confused. And of
                course it's subjective what counts as a “special meaning,” so a few of them you may feel are just words
                that often get used to end clauses but still mean the same thing.

                If you've been seriously attempting to read source material up to this point, then most of the
                subsections below will probably cover things you've more or less figured out on your own (consciously or
                otherwise). My goal in talking about them is not so much to teach you new things, as it is to give you
                an idea of how well you intuitively understand Japanese, and get you to start consciously thinking about
                some of the more subtle and complex issues with Japanese grammar (especially in contrast with English)
                which you might not have noticed.
            </p>

            <p><u>Ambiguity and Context</u></p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                There are two quick things I'd like to show you to get you thinking about some of the more subtle issues
                that come up once you can understand multi-clause sentences.
            </p>

            <p>
                First, the subject of the subordinate clause is not necessarily the noun it modifies. Even the object
                (if any) doesn't have to be located anywhere in the clause. Instead it may be in a previous sentence or
                clause, or it may be the “context” denoted by
                <span lang="ja">は</span>. Since this is only useful or common during a long conversation where the
                subjects and objects intended gradually become obvious, there's not much point in giving more than one
                simple example here:
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="ja">何をあげたらいいと思う</span>？</td>
                    <td>What do you think I should give her?</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="ja">あげたいもの</span></td>
                    <td>Something you want to give her.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                That example should also make it very clear what I meant at the beginning when I said Japanese relies on
                context and leaves things implied a lot more than English.
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                Second, consider this sentence:
                <span lang="ja">脱出するものは支援せよといったから行く。</span>
                Obviously, there are two subordinate clauses (if you interpret the quote as a clause). However, it is
                not clear whether the second subordinate clause encompasses the first one or not, giving us two valid
                but very different meanings:
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 10pt"
                    >“(those who escape [subject] reinforce) said [so] go” = “We're going because he said to backup
                    anyone who escapes.”</span
                >
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 10pt"
                    >“(those who escape) [subject] (reinforce) said [so] go” = “We're going because the escapees said to
                    back those guys up.”</span
                >
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                Notice that, without any context, it is impossible to tell which of these two interpretations is
                correct. Fortunately, in context, it will usually be very easy to tell which meaning is intended.
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                Also, the distinction between <span lang="ja">は</span> and <span lang="ja">が</span> is relevant here,
                since <span lang="ja">が</span> is more likely to be found inside a subordinate clause and
                <span lang="ja">は</span> less so (though if context, tone of voice or anything else imply the contrary,
                follow those cues instead). On occasion you may be able to eliminate one or the other option by noticing
                a particular verb is strictly intransitive.

            <p><u>Tenses In Subordinate Clauses</u></p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                Interpreting a single tense in a single clause is generally pretty simple, since many of the most basic
                tenses in Japanese can be accurately equated with basic English tenses. However, the way you interpret
                tenses of verbs in subordinate clauses can be subtly different. Consider the following sentence:
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="ja">考えるうちに授業が終わった</span></td>
                    <td>Class ended while I was thinking.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                Notice that <span lang="ja">考える</span> is in nonpast form, even though the act of thinking takes
                place in the past. The English tense ("was _ing") makes the past-ness explicit. In my opinion, the trick
                here is: because the <span lang="ja">考える</span> is in the subordinate clause, its tense should be
                interpreted <i>relative to the tense of the main clause</i>. In this case, the "thinking" occurs in the
                present <i>relative</i> to when the "ending" happened (which means the "thinking" happened at the same
                time as the "ending"). Since the "ending" is in past tense, that means the "thinking" also happened in
                the past. If your brain is operating in Japanese then this might make sense. A different example:
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <span lang="ja">その方程式を暗記したらテストを合格したはず</span>
                    </td>
                    <td>If I'd memorized that equation I probably would've passed that test.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                <span lang="ja">合格した</span> is in simple past form despite the fact that no "passing" ever took
                place. In English we have to use a "would've" to mark the hypothetical status of this act. No further
                analysis should be necessary, though it's worth explicitly saying that Japanese completely lacks a
                direct equivalent to "would" because, as you can see, it simply doesn't need one.

            <p><u>Compound Particles Revisited</u></p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                Some of the compound particles can be explained a little better once you understand clause-ending nouns.
                Basically, I think
                <span lang="ja">の</span> can be short for <span lang="ja">事</span> koto or
                <span lang="ja">もの</span> mono, especially if in a compound particle.
            </p>

            <p>To convince you this works, let's bring in some old examples:</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja">読むとすぐに眠るの（こと）は何故</span></span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 9pt">Why is it that you fall asleep right away when reading something?</span>
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja">また変なの（もの）が</span></span
                ><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja">来た</span></span
                ><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja">みたい</span></span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 9pt">Looks like another weird thing came.</span>
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 10pt"
                    ><span lang="ja">二ヶ月書くの（こと）が危険だけど一つの名作くらい書きたい</span></span
                >
            </p>

            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 9pt"
                    >It's dangerous writing for two months straight, but I wanna write at least one masterpiece.</span
                >
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja">そんなに綺麗なの（もの）か</span>？</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 9pt">Is is that pretty?</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 8pt"> </span>
            </p>

            <p>
                Similarly, <span lang="ja">に</span> in a compound particle may loosely resemble
                <span lang="ja">場合</span> ba'ai or <span lang="ja">所</span> tokoro.
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja">私に（の場合で）は蛇が恐ろしい</span></span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 9pt">For me, snakes are terrifying.</span>
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja">科学に（のところ）は詳しい人の方が好ましい</span></span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span style="font-size: 9pt">In science, the knowledgeable person is more desirable.</span>
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                These are probably the most useful comparisons, but I think most compound particles can be explained (at
                least in some of their uses) in a similar way if desired.

                And now, just for good measure, some examples of painfully long sentences. Because long multi-clause
                sentences normally only occur deep in context, natural-sounding examples aren't really possible, so I
                had fun stretching these out until they got ridiculous.
