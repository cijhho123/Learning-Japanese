Hiragana is one of the three core scripts in the Japanese writing system, alongside katakana and kanji. It’s a syllabary: each character represents a single syllable such as a vowel, a consonant plus vowel (like ka), or the special nasal sound n. Its name literally means "ordinary kana," reflecting its use in everyday, informal writing as opposed to the more formal kanji. In modern Japanese, hiragana is essential for writing grammatical elements such as particles, verb and adjective endings (okurigana), and native words whose kanji are uncommon or nonexistent.


The ability to read hiragana is going to be a prerequisite for most beginner Japanese textbooks and resources.  It is vital to memorize the Kana and along with it the sound system when learning Japanese. It can normally be done within days to weeks depending on the individual and will be used in almost every Japanese sentence onwards.

# katakana
![Katakana Chart](<./katakana-chart.webp>)

Katakana is one of the three main writing systems in Japanese. It’s a syllabary: each character represents a syllable rather than a single phoneme, and consists of about 46 basic signs that parallel hiragana in sound but differ in appearance. Today, it’s primarily used for transcribing foreign loanwords, writing foreign names, onomatopoeia, scientific and technical terms, and for emphasis: kind of like italics in English.
