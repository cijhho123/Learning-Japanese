5
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:13,798
hi everyone I'm Raisa welcome to basic

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,798
Japanese

7
00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:19,320
writing in this series I'm going to

8
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:22,359
teach you how to master the Japanese

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,118
alphabet in the fastest easiest and most

10
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:28,679
fun way did you know written Japanese

11
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:30,640
actually uses three different Scripts

12
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:34,159
hiana kak

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,640
and Ki hiragana is the basic Japanese

14
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,959
alphabet contrary to the English

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,799
alphabet however each character

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,439
represents one Sy sound so every time

17
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:47,038
you see one specific character you know

18
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:49,799
that it will always sound the same way

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,239
the second script used in Japanese is

20
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,399
Katakana each Katakana character

21
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,558
represents the same syllable as it

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,480
hilana

23
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,679
counterpart however it is written a bit

24
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,439
differently and is used mostly for

25
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:05,599
foreign words these two make up the

26
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,840
Japanese alphabet and they will be the

27
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:11,478
focus of this series on the other hand

28
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,560
Kani characters represent a word or a

29
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:17,319
concept and unlike kagana and Katakana

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,640
there are thousands of them plus there

31
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:22,599
are also different leadings for each of

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,560
them this makes Kani characters harder

33
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:27,759
to master however it's important to

34
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,799
learn them as well because they are

35
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,280
essential in understanding Japanese

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,960
to learn more about kanji check out our

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,118
kanji series at Japanese Port 101.com

38
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:41,959
which I also host with

39
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,438
Alicia in this first lesson we will be

40
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:46,679
diving into hilana and you'll be

41
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:49,359
learning your first five

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,880
characters hiragana characters are the

43
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,680
most common of the three scripts because

44
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:57,158
it's used to write functional words like

45
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,680
grammatical particles and are also

46
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,680
commonly found at the end of adjectives

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,560
and and verbs there are also a lots of

48
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,960
vers that are more commonly written in

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,479
hiragana rather than kanji technically

50
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:13,039
hiragana characters could also be used

51
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,879
to substitute Kani characters that you

52
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:19,239
don't know how to write but don't use

53
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:21,799
this as an excuse not to learn Kani

54
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,120
there are 46 sagana characters and they

55
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,000
are commonly arranged in this

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,239
order take note that when Japanese is

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,519
written vertically you read it from

58
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,439
right to left

59
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,640
so we'll be starting with this column

60
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,159
these five characters are the five vowel

61
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:40,039
sounds in Japanese the rest of the

62
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,239
characters are made up of a consonant

63
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:46,359
sound and one of these vow sounds except

64
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:49,840
for the N character okay are you ready

65
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,879
to learn your first hilana here we go

66
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,878
this is the hilana

67
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:01,479
character to remember this Cala try

68
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:05,079
comparing it it with an

69
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:05,079
apple do you see

70
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:10,878
it next up is the hiragana

71
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:20,560
character think of this character as two

72
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,560
eyes side by side

73
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,080
e you can actually see E A Lot in

74
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,878
writing as it acts like a suffix to most

75
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,159
adjectives in Japanese

76
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,158
the third one is the

77
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:45,158
hiana to remember this character imagine

78
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,158
a boxer getting punched in the stomach

79
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,760
saying this is the H

80
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,719
character it looks like an energetic

81
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:01,719
ninja

82
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:06,840
whoosh

83
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:06,840
now our final character for this lesson

84
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:16,079
theana to remember o try to think of it

85
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,079
as a

86
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,959
UFO take a look at these two characters

87
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:27,199
do you remember this character on the

88
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:30,359
left that's right it's the hiragana H in

89
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,639
order to differentiate hiragana or o

90
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,919
from a just remember that o has a

91
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:39,720
floating stroke on the

92
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:42,478
side o is also often used in writing but

93
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,520
unlike it or is commonly found at the

94
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:48,240
beginning of words it is used to imply

95
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:54,560

101
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:19,918
ninja believe it or not it's actually a

102
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:19,918
word e means

hiragana characters I used to spell out

112
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:11,519
the pronunciation of a Kani they are

113
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:15,680
placed above or beside Ai and written

114
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:18,639
smaller this use of hilana is called

115
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,160
fana okay let's wrap up this lesson by

116
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,800
recapping what you've

117
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:31,560
learned in this lesson you've learned

118
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:31,560
the five hilag virus a e u e n o

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,839
you've now mastered your first five

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,839
Cals hi everyone welcome to basic

121
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:44,719
Japanese writing the fastest easiest and

122
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:44,719
most fun way to master the Japanese

123
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,360
alphabet you've learned these five

124
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:54,598
hilana characters from the previous

125
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,038
lesson in this lesson you learn five new

126
00:06:54,598 --> 00:07:01,598
characters and 10 new sounds how is that

127
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:04,959
possible stay tuned to find

128
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:09,639
out the first hilana character for this

129
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,638
lesson is C

130
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:18,519
cup need help remembering this one just

131
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,520
imagine it as a blade cutting a

132
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:25,399
stick cut is actually

133
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,560
aana that is used a lot since it is the

134
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:31,679
question marking particle in Japanese so

135
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,759
if you see a sentence ending in c it is

136
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,879
most probably a

137
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:40,598
question the hiragana also has another

138
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:43,919
reading once we add this Mark this Mark

139
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:47,759
is called D or

140
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:50,680
t it is made up of two lines that look

141
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,319
like a quotation mark symbol and it's

142
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,360
put on the upper right corner of the

143
00:07:53,319 --> 00:08:00,598
character the D makes the consonant of

144
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:04,158
the syllable of voice so C with a D will

145
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:06,560
be pronounced as G voicing a consonant

146
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:11,478
simply means that you create a vibration

147
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,240
in your vocal cord when you say it g g

148
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:16,240
notice the

149
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,240
difference

150
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,800
G okay next up is

151
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:31,439
theana key looks like a key

152
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,959
just like the hilana all of the

153
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:46,799
characters in this column can be aled by

154
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:51,000
a d k with a d is pronounced as g k g

155
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,000
k the third one is the

156
00:08:53,679 --> 00:09:01,439
hilana to remember this calor think of

157
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:01,440
it as a cuckoo speak cucko

158
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:11,399
let's add a d to C as well how do you

159
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:11,399
think it will sound like it's pronounced

160
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,560
as this is the hiragana

161
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,879
character K looks like a cake doesn't

162
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,759
it just just like the first three

163
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:39,120
characters K can be modified by a DCT K

164
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:39,120
with a DCT is pronounced as

165
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:48,319
K and our final character for this

166
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:48,319
lesson is

167
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:58,320
theana imagine this character as two koi

168
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:01,239
fish swimming around each

169
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,160
other

170
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,720
now can you go and say what Co sounds

171
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,120
like with a

172
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,480
duct it will be

173
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:16,919
go

174
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,920
go go let's see all the characters

175
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,679
again k

176
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:30,600
g k g co

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,200
go now let's give you what you've

178
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:37,720
learned I'll show you a character or a

179
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,720
word and give you time to say them

180
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,639
ready K just like a key

181
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:54,120
remember c c actually means a

182
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,120
mosquito do you remember this

183
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,200

it

185
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,159
I

186
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,279
co this means to

187
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:23,799
write k k means

188
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:32,319
Shadow K this means to listen try not to

189
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,320
mix this up with

190
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,599
Kaku is

191
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,720
voice k k means key don't forget

192
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:54,200
it this means memory make sure not to

193
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,200
forget this one as

194
00:11:55,039 --> 00:12:01,240
well aa aa is movie

195
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,600
this means

196
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:10,880
big great job I am wondering how do I

197
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,159
identify between a duct Mark and a

198
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:16,720
quotation mark don't worry in Japanese

199
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:19,439
we use corner brackets to signify quotes

200
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,399
and titles instead of quotation

201
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,000
marks okay let's wrap up this lesson by

202
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,000
recapping what you've

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:37,639
learned in this lesson you learned C and

204
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:37,639
g k and G C and G K and G and Co and

205
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:43,278
go you've now mastered 10 characters and

206
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:46,319
15 Japanese syllable

207
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:49,120
sounds hi everyone welcome to basic

208
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:53,079
Japanese writing the fastest easiest and

209
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,078
most fun way to master the Japanese

210
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,079
alphabet you've learned this tagana

211
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:02,958
characters from the previous lessons

212
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:06,519
in this lesson you learn five new

213
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:09,439
characters and again 10 new

214
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:11,720
sounds the first hiragana character for

215
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,720
this lesson is

216
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,720
s

217
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,000
sa this one looks like a s sign

218
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:28,559
face do you notice that sa and K look

219
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:32,319
similar a good tip to remember the

220
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:35,919
difference is that s is so sad that it

221
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:39,160
gets one less line all of the characters

222
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:42,120
in this column can also be altered by a

223
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:46,000
zaken can you try and guess what the new

224
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,639
sound will be it will be Z do you notice

225
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,839
the

226
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,159
difference

227
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:57,279
z

228
00:13:52,159 --> 00:14:01,039
z okay next up is the hiragana Cal

229
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,039
sh sh

230
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:06,039
it looks like a fishing

231
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:13,399
hook let's add a DCT to sh how do you

232
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:17,560
think it will sound like now did you

233
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:23,078
think it was Z actually she with a DCT

234
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:23,078
is pronounced as G sh

235
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:31,039
G the third one is theana s

236
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,399
s s looks like a s p Stoll in a

237
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:47,000
glass let's add a du then to sue as well

238
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,799
what do you think it will sound like

239
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,799
it's pronounced

240
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:03,559
as this is the hiana character

241
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,559
set

242
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:12,480
set imagine set as a m facing sideways

243
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,480
it's about to say

244
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:20,959
something let's modify set with a

245
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,320
dent it is now pronounced as

246
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:25,198
z

247
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,000
z

248
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:30,799
z and our final character for this

249
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,799
lesson is the

250
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,799
so

251
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:41,758
so to remember so just imagine a zigzag

252
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:41,758
sewing

253
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:51,240
Stitch now can you go and say what so

254
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:53,198
sounds like with a duct it will be zo

255
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:57,680
so

256
00:15:53,198 --> 00:16:00,919
so let's see all the characters again sa

257
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,919

alphabet you've learned these 15 hilana

318
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,159
characters from the previous

00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,960
lessons in this lesson you learn five

320
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:58,080
new characters 10 new syllable sounds

321
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,038
and an extra character function curious

322
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:04,079
stay tuned to learn all about

323
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:06,919

lesson is

325
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:09,919
t

326
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:18,000
t t actually looks like a t like a small

327
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,000
letter T N

328
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,400
A all of the hiragana in this column can

329
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,480
be aled by DCT as well can you guess

330
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,240
what the new sound will be after adding

331
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:33,880
a DCT to TP

332
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:35,960
it will be da T

333
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,799
da

334
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,480
da okay next up is the hiragana

335
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:43,480
character

336
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,480
ch

337
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:49,158
ch does a chi remind you of another

338
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:52,639
character it looks like the mirror image

339
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:57,600
of sa doesn't it just think of chi as a

340
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:00,200
cheer reader angry at s for copying

341
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:03,678
her

342
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:07,720
now let's add a duct to CH how do you

343
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:11,440
think it will sound like now is it D

344
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:16,200
actually CH with a is pronounced as G

345
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,200
it's just like a sh with a

346
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,079
G the third hiana for this lesson

347
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:33,278
is

348
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:36,678
this hiragana is very easy to remember s

349
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:36,679
looks like a tsunami

350
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:44,200
wave let's add the duct to two as well

351
00:21:41,278 --> 00:21:47,278
how do you think it will sound like it's

352
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,519
actually pronounced as it's similar to S

353
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:51,919
with a

354
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:51,918
d listen

355
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,720
carefully actually T has a special

356
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,600
version that look looks like this and

357
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,079
it's called

358
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:07,678
CH literally

359
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:10,839
small it's actually just the smaller

360
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:14,600
size to so what do we use it

361
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:17,319
for the CH side is used to prolong the

362
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:19,879
consonant after it take a look at the

363
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:22,158
following examples and listen to how I

364
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,159
say

365
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,000
them to compare here are some words

366
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,000
without

367
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,720
it now listen as I say them side by

368
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:55,359
side when found at the end of the word

369
00:22:49,759 --> 00:23:00,440
that CH acts like a Gro stop for example

370
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,439
ah next is aana character

371
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,079
looks like a dog

372
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:16,678
ta let's modify t with a d it is now

373
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,678
pronounced

374
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,038
as our final character for this lesson

375
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,440
is theana

376
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:29,599
to

377
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,679
to

378
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:32,678

422
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:49,639
and you've now mastered 20 characters

423
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,000
and 35 Japanese syllable sounds hi

424
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:55,240
everyone welcome to basic Japanese

425
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,240
writing the fastest easiest and most fun

426
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,390
way to master the Japanese

427
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,480
alphabet

428
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,320
[Music]

429
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,079
you've learned these 20 hiragana

430
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:07,720
characters in the previous

431
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:10,158
lessons in this lesson you learn five

432
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,720
new hilana

433
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:15,799
characters the first hilana character

434
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,798
for this lesson is

435
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:18,798
n

436
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:24,879
n think of Na as a complicated

437
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:32,439
nut are you confused between T and na

438
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:35,839
just remember that na looks more

439
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:40,919
complicated so it gets mixed up in a nut

440
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:44,558
also remember that the left side of T is

441
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:47,559
taller do you remember that is used as

442
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:50,278
the suffix for most adjectives these are

443
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:53,519
called e adjectives the other kind of

444
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:57,119
adjectives are the n adjectives this use

445
00:27:53,519 --> 00:28:02,159
theana as the particle to connect two

446
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:02,158
nouns okay next up is the hiragana

447
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:11,678
character KN looks like a knee easy to

448
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:11,678
remember

449
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:16,759
right the third one is the

450
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,360
hiana to remember this character think

451
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,120
of a pair of Chopsticks holding a bunch

452
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:30,119
of

453
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:30,119
noodles

454
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,519
this is

455
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:43,360
the think of net as a snail hiding

456
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:43,359
behind a

457
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:51,159
nail net looks similar to n doesn't it

458
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,599
well just remember that you need a pair

459
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:57,679
of Chopsticks to be able to hold your

460
00:28:53,599 --> 00:29:01,158
noodles so n has two lines sticking out

461
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:03,960
on top top of the curve and net just has

462
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:07,159
one and our final character for this

463
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:10,159
lesson is the hiragana

464
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:10,159
no

465
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:16,919
no it's easy to remember this one it's

466
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,919
like a no

467
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:25,200
sign no is also widely used hilana it is

468
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:30,038
the particle used to denote possession

469
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,038
let's see all the characters again now

00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:39,359

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:52,480
ready KN just like a knee remember which

474
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:52,480
one is the H

there's no D version of

494
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:28,398
n this is because the nend sound is

master the Japanese alphabet

506
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:03,839
[Music]

507
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,759
you've learned these 25 hiana characters

508
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:08,638
from the previous

509
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:12,759
lessons in this lesson you learn five

510
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:15,759
new colors and 16 new sounds I promise

511
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:17,759
it will be easy so stay tuned to learn

512
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,720
all about

513
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:23,319
them the first hilana character for this

514
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,319
lesson is

515
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:26,319
h

516
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:33,720
h to remember ha imagine this part is a

517
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:37,880
capital letter H and then there's a

518
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,880
small a in front of it

519
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:46,319
h h might look similar to K so it may be

520
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:51,080
confusing to tell the difference between

521
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:54,398
them remember that ha has a hoop did you

522
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:56,960
miss the Duan last lesson well this

523
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:58,678
column can be modified by adding a Zan

524
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,200
as well can you can you guess what the

525
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:09,399
new sound will be after adding a duct to

526
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:12,840
ha it will be B ha ba

527
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:18,678
ha but wait there's one more Mark that

528
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:22,439
can modify the H column it's the H or

529
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:24,798
Mar mark it looks like a small circle

530
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,960
and it's placed in the same position as

531
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:30,960
the D then this Mark makes the consonant

532
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:35,558
of the syllable Prive and it's Unique to

533
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:37,639
this column H with a hand is

534
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:40,398
pronounced

535
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:43,439
ha ha

536
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:45,638
p a consonant explosive when there's a

537
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:50,480
big breast of air coming out of your

538
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:54,000
mouth when you say it P P try to feel

539
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,000
the difference

540
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:03,080
h h is also a popular hilana it's a

541
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,919
topic marking particle in Japanese so

542
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:07,759
the word or phrase that comes before it

543
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,159
is the topic of the

544
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:13,358
sentence but be careful ha is pronounced

545
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:16,358
differently when it's used as a topic

546
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:17,838
marking particle it will be pronounced

547
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:21,039
as

548
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:21,039
what for

549
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:31,759
example many speakers actually find it

550
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:34,440
hard to read this last example if it's

551
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,720
written just in hilana this is where

552
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:40,079
Kani is very useful knowing which part

553
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:42,279
is a word and which part is a particle

554
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:46,720
makes it easy to read

555
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,720
Japanese okay next up is the

556
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:56,639
hilana can you see a smiling mouth going

557
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,799
he he he he

558
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:04,199
he

559
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:11,320
now let's add a DCT to he he with a DCT

560
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:15,679
is pronounced as be he be he

561
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:18,320
be and how will it sound like with a h

562
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:18,319
it's going to

563
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:26,639
be

564
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:32,358
he the third hiana for this lesson

565
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:36,239
is it's not who or who but somewhere in

566
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:36,239
between who

567
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:42,760
who it's a sound unique to Japanese so

568
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:47,039
let's remember it with something unique

569
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,040
to Japan Mount

570
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:55,199
Fuji let's try adding a duct to Fu as

571
00:35:51,838 --> 00:36:00,559
well how do you think it will sound it's

572
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:03,000
pronounced as B listen carefully

573
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:07,639
H

574
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,880
H now let's try it with a hak then it

575
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:12,039
becomes

576
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,000
p

577
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:18,199
p

578
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,199
p next is the hiragana

579
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:29,559
character it looks like it's pointing up

580
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:29,559
to heaven where the sky is

581
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:38,159
let's modify he with a

582
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,160
DCT it's now pronounced as be

583
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:47,920
he and when he is modified with a hand

584
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:47,920
it will be pronounced

585
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:57,279
as he is the particle used to indicate

586
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,359
the place towards which something is

587
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,640
moving

588
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:05,400
moving just like ha he also changes

589
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:10,279
pronunciation when used as a particle in

590
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:14,160
this case we pronounce it as just like

591
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,160
the listen to some

592
00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:22,599
examples our final character for this

593
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,599
lesson is

594
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:32,199
the try by imagining a horse's face with

595
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:34,440
its man on the left side to remember

596
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:34,439
this

597
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:42,559
character does ho remind you of ha they

598
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:46,480
both have a hoop so how do you remember

599
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:50,159
them well H has two horizontal lines and

600
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:54,280
ha only has one so this means ha has

601
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:59,440
only half the lines and H has the whole

602
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:02,920
lot what does H sound like with the

603
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:05,119
with a DCT is pronounced

604
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:11,639
b

605
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:13,640
b b and with a hand it will be

606
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:20,000
po

607
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:23,118
po po let's see all calaes again H or if

608
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,119
it's used as a

609
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:30,919
particle

610
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,920
he p

611
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:37,199
h he or if it is used as a

612
00:38:43,318 --> 00:38:48,480
particle now let's give you what you've

613
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:53,000

word and give you time to say them

615
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,760
ready remember that is like Mount

616
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:05,039
Fuji

617
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:12,400
B it has the handon which makes it

618
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,400
plosive so it's

619
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:22,239
pet now remember it's a complicated nut

620
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:22,239
right which one is the

621
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:31,239
hiana it's this one with the hoop and H

00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:31,239
the horizontal lines as

623
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,079

635
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:38,039
perfectionist great job as you learn

636
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:41,199
more characters you notice that some of

637
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:43,880
them look similar try making a chart of

638
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:46,279
your own grouping similar characters and

639
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:49,559
list down a unique feature you can find

640
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:52,800
for each so that when you see it you can

641
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:54,719

00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:54,119
for this lesson is

660
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,119
ma

661
00:41:54,719 --> 00:42:02,279

character the one where the Chopsticks

673
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,599
are holding some

674
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,119
noodles but look this part is now

675
00:42:53,599 --> 00:43:00,119
missing this means that the Chopsticks

676
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:00,119
dropped some noodles and made a

677
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:07,440
mess and our final character for this

678
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,440
lesson is

679
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:17,800

long

682
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:27,800
tail Ma and mo might be confusing

683
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:31,119
because they look similar but just

684
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:36,599

685
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:36,599

hiana easier share them in the comments

713
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:47,639
below okay let's wrap up this lesson by

714
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:52,838
recapping what you've learned in this

715
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:52,838
lesson you learned hiragana characters

716
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:58,119
Ma and

717
00:45:55,719 --> 00:46:01,399

you've now mastered 35 characters and 61

719
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:07,160
Japanese syllable sounds hi everyone

720
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:09,440
welcome to basic Japanese writing the

721
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:12,480
fastest easiest and most fun way to

722
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,480
master the Japanese

723
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:18,960
alphabet you've learned these 35

724
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,800
hiragana characters from the previous

725
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,880
lessons in this lesson you learn five

726
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:26,519
new hilana

727
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:29,358
characters the first hilana character

728
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:32,358
for this this lesson is

729
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:32,358
l

730
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:39,760
l think of L as a rabbit sitting on its

731
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,760
hind

732
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:47,039
legs is it hard to tell between LA and

733
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:49,078
Chi just remember that Chi has the top

734
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:53,759
part crossing

735
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:53,760
over okay next up is the hilana

736
00:46:55,838 --> 00:47:03,199
color

737
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,200
Le looks like a river easy to remember

738
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:10,960
right e and Le look very similar

739
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:13,399
especially when L one way to remember

740
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,960
the difference is that the right stroke

741
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:21,160
of re is longer and it flows like a

742
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,159
river the third one is the

743
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:31,640
hiragana to remember this Cal

744
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:31,639
think of it as a hand holding a

745
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,440
ruby this is the

746
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:46,199
hilana think of le as a reindeer looking

747
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:52,679
up and our final Cal for this lesson

748
00:47:55,838 --> 00:48:02,039
is

749
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:04,318
remember L it looks very similar right

750
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:08,960
but where's the ruby the hand was

751
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:08,960
holding it's gone now so you got

752
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:14,239
robed let's see all the characters

753
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:24,240
again now let's give you what you've

754
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:28,759

unicorn you is also a popular H but not

805
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:48,280
because of how it's used in a sentence

806
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:51,759
but because it is used as a mark for

807
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:54,599
onent or hot spring bath you actually

808
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:57,480

from a

814
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,480
finger there's another set of syllables

815
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:23,358
in Japanese which is formed by adding

816
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:24,880
the Y U or your sound to a consonant

817
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:29,318
plus an e

818
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:31,480
sound this time the the y u and your

819
00:52:29,318 --> 00:52:34,159
characters are written

820
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:38,119
smaller these are the Japanese diagraphs

821
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:39,920
called y even though they look longer

822
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:42,000
they are still the same length in

823
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,318
syllables as the previous characters

824
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,318
that you've

825
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,480
learned

826
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,440
Sha

827
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:25,440
technically you could also make a

828
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:28,200
diagraph with G but it's not in use

829
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,240
anymore one thing to note is that you

830
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:32,399
need to be careful when writing or

831
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:34,279
pronouncing them they are written

832
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,440
smaller and they are pronounced by

833
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:39,319
gliding to the Y sound and not

834
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:41,400
pronouncing the e sound doing it

835
00:53:39,318 --> 00:53:42,279
otherwise might get you a completely

836
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:47,480
different

837
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:50,240
word here's an example do means Dragon

838
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:55,000
but do means

839
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:57,000
reason another one is co meaning today

840
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:02,679
however when you pronounce the the e

841
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:05,318
sound and say k it means handy or

842
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:08,318

00:57:25,159 --> 00:57:32,598
what what do you remember that the

889
00:57:28,838 --> 00:57:36,279
hilana ha is pronounced as what if it's

890
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:40,280
a particle well the W sound is actually

891
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:40,280
signified by this character as

892
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:47,640
well to remember what think of it as a

893
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:47,639
white

894
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,400
swine many people have a hard time

895
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:58,960
remembering

896
00:57:53,400 --> 00:58:02,318
NE and because left Hales look the same

897
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:05,960
hopefully our neonics can come to the

898
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:09,519
rescue remember net is the snail with a

899
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:12,760
spiral in its shell there is a reindeer

900
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:15,400
looking up in the sky and what is a

901
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:18,880
white swan floating on the

902
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:22,318
water this is the hilana

903
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:25,119
character what it is also commonly said

904
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:27,639
as o

905
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:32,160
o

906
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:32,159
try to think of w as a crack in the

907
00:58:33,318 --> 00:58:40,159
wall what is a very distinct character

908
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:43,079
it is never used in a word but instead

909
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:45,920
it functions as the object marking

910
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:48,400
particle so whenever you say this it

911
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,838
means that the word before it is the

912
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,720
object of the

913
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:56,679
sentence for

914
00:58:52,719 --> 00:58:58,279
example this means I ate an apple the

915
00:58:56,679 --> 00:59:04,358
object of the

916
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:08,680
verb or at is lingo or apple and it's

917
00:59:04,358 --> 00:59:12,880
the one that comes before W our final

918
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:12,879
character for this lesson is

919
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:21,920
the this one's easy it looks like an

920
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,920
italized

921
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:28,440
N is also special

922
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:31,199
because you can never start a word with

923
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:34,400
it it could only be found in the middle

924
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:36,239
or at the end of words one more thing

925
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,519
that's special about is that its

926
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:41,078
pronunciation varies a bit depending on

927
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:44,119
the syllable that comes after

928
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:47,079
it it can sometimes have an N sound when

929
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:51,160
it comes before a b or P sound for

930
00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:53,640
example com and compai and sometimes it

931
00:59:51,159 --> 00:59:56,960
can have a n sound when it comes before

932
00:59:53,639 --> 01:00:00,480
a g sound like in hangaku

933
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,480
let's see all the characters

934
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:05,598
