5
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:22,079
Japanese Writing, the fastest, easiest,

6
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,079
and most fun way to master the Japanese

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,160
alphabet. You've learned all the 46

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,200
hiragana characters from the previous

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:35,039
lessons. Now it's time to move on to

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,280
katakana. In this lesson you learn about

11
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,679
katakana, how it is different from

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,760
hiragana and the five katakana

13
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:46,039
vows. Katakana is the exact equivalent

14
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:48,718
of hiragana when it comes to

15
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:51,679
pronunciation. The main difference is

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,719
how the characters look and when they

17
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:57,920
are used. Katakana characters tend to

18
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,480
look more angular. There is also almost

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,640
nothing in common with how katakana

20
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:06,920
characters look compared to their

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,519
hiragana counterparts except for a few

22
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,840
characters. So why is it that we need to

23
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:15,359
learn two basic writing systems when

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,920
they both sound exactly the same? The

25
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,239
main use of katakana is to differentiate

26
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,439
and spell out foreign words using the

27
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,879
Japanese syllary. This makes it easier

28
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:29,199
for Japanese people to know how they are

29
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:32,000
approximately pronounced. Most country

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,079
names, foreign names, and all learn

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,159
words from the modern era are written in

32
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:40,478
katakana. Katakana is also used to write

33
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,719
down onomatotopia sounds like how you

34
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,640
would see sound effects written in

35
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,478
Japanese

36
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,319
manga. It is also used to write some

37
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:53,599
technical or scientific words. Finally,

38
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,959
katakana is also used for emphasis just

39
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,640
like how English uses

40
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:01,798
italics. Okay, it's time to learn your

41
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:07,040
first katakana. Are you ready? Here we

42
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,040
go. This is the katakana character.

43
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:17,958
A to remember this character, try

44
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:17,959
comparing it with an axe. Do you see it?

45
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,360
Next up is the katakana character.

46
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,800
E. Think of this character as an easel

47
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:30,799
on its

48
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:38,799
side. The third one is the

49
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,800
katakana.

50
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:44,680
Uh katakana actually looks like an

51
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,679
angular version of the

52
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,680
hilagana.

53
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:53,598
Here's a special use of the daken unique

54
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,680
to katakana. It is added to the

55
00:02:53,598 --> 00:03:00,159
character U to signify the letter V.

56
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,239
However, there is no V sound in

57
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,199
Japanese. So, most people would

58
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:09,280
pronounce this as a V

59
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,280
sound. This is the katakana character.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,959
E. Try imagining this character as

61
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:16,958
elevator

62
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,760
doors. Now our final character for this

63
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,360
lesson

64
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:34,400
O to remember O try to think of it as an

65
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,400
opera

66
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:45,799
singer. Unlike hiragana where long vowel

67
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,640
sounds are indicated using another vowel

68
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:52,400
character, katakana writing makes use of

69
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:55,279
the novashi. So instead of writing a

70
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,519
with two a characters, we would write it

71
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,759
like

72
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:02,080
this. Literally novasho means stretching

73
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,919
ver. So when you see it, just remember

74
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,519
that you have to stretch the vowel of

75
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,518
the character that comes before

76
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,719
it. In order to accommodate more sounds

77
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,280
available from foreign words, katakana

78
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:19,918
uses the small versions of the v

79
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,359
characters to make diagraphs outside of

80
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:25,599
those used in Japanese. For example,

81
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,319
since Japanese doesn't have a character

82
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:34,960
for a wi or v sound, the katakana paired

83
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,879
with a small e or is used to denote

84
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,039
those

85
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:41,040
sounds.

86
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,280
We because they are diagraphs though

87
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,879
they would still be pronounced for the

88
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:48,319
same duration as all the other

89
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:51,399
syllables. Here are the diagraphs you

90
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,399
can form using the katakana vows alone.

91
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:55,638
Yeah,

92
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:58,638
we

93
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,639
V

94
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:06,000
B. Since most Japanese people can't

95
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,079
distinguish between the V and B sounds,

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,120
these last four diagramraphs tend to

97
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:15,439
also be spelled using the B characters

98
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,360
B, B, B, and B.

99
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,038
I'll be teaching you more katakana

100
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,199
diagramraphs when we encounter the

101
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,360
character that the small vowels could be

102
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,000
paired up

103
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,038
with. Let's see all the characters

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,038
again. A

105
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:33,918
e

106
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:37,240
v o. Here are the new diagramraphs as

107
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:39,560
well. Yeah,

108
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,639
we

109
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,199
w

110
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,600
b v

111
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,160
Now, let's review what you've learned.

112
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,919
I'll show you a character or a word and

113
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,919
give you time to say them.

114
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Ready?

115
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:06,800
Oh. So, even though we move to katakana,

116
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,800
don't forget your hiragana

117
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:13,959
characters. It's like an easel on its

118
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,959
side.

119
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,000
Remember the

120
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,879
cow

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,759
we Japanese people would say when we

122
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:38,758
realized something like ah I forgot my

123
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,759
wallet.

124
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:47,439
Ooh. Oh, on the other hand is what we

125
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,079
say when we are amazed.

126
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,560
Great job. Remember, even if foreign

127
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,159
words are adopted by Japanese, this

128
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,639
doesn't mean they are pronounced the

129
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,160
same way as the original word, you still

130
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,560
need to pronounce them using the

131
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,439
Japanese syllary in order for Japanese

132
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,439
people to understand you.

133
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,719
Okay, let's wrap up this lesson by

134
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,719
recapping what you've

135
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:16,319
learned. In this lesson, you've learned

136
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:20,000
the five katakana vowels, A, E, U, E,

137
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:23,520
and O. You also learned that the

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,038
character U can be modified by a duct to

139
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:30,839
represent the B sound. And finally, some

140
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:33,159
new diagramraphs. Yeah,

141
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:36,159
we

142
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,160
w

143
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:44,559
B. You've now mastered 51 Japanese

144
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:47,120
characters. Hi everyone. Welcome to

145
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,038
basic Japanese writing. The fastest,

146
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,629
easiest, and most fun way to master the

147
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,199
Japanese

148
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:54,240
[Music]

149
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,240
alphabet. You've learned these five

150
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,639
katakana characters from the previous

151
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,160
lesson.

152
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,598
In this lesson, you'll learn five new

153
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,439
characters. Remember the duck? Then

154
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:09,439
we'll see it again in this

155
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:11,800
lesson. The first katakana character for

156
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:14,800
this lesson

157
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,800
is

158
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:24,400
K. Katakana. Actually looks like a more

159
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,400
angular version of hira without this

160
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,280
stroke. Just like in the K column of

161
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:34,759
hiragana, the K column of katakana can

162
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:37,278
also be changed by the daken or tenten

163
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:42,838
mark. We put it in the upper right

164
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:44,200
corner. So now it will be pronounced G C

165
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,200
G C K C K C K C K C K C K C K C K C K C

166
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,440
K

167
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,160
G. Okay, next up is the katakana

168
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,160
character

169
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:54,159
Ki

170
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:02,480
Ki also looks like its hiraagana

171
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,480
counterpart but without this part at the

172
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:10,399
bottom. Just like the katakana, we could

173
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:17,480
also put a den on it. K with a den is

174
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:17,480
pronounced as g k g

175
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:25,440
G. The third one is the

176
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,440
katakana

177
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:35,519
C. If hiragana is a cuckoo's beak, then

178
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,519
try remembering katakana as the cuckoo's

179
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:47,080
tail. Let's add a duck to c as well.

180
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:52,399
It's now pronounced as G C G C

181
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:52,399
G. This is a katakana character.

182
00:09:54,919 --> 00:10:01,278
K. Try looking at it from this angle and

183
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,278
you'll see a letter

184
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:08,639
K. Just like the first three characters,

185
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:16,439
K can be modified by a duct. K with a

186
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:19,439
duct ten is pronounced as G K G K

187
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,279
G. And our final character for this

188
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,279
lesson is the

189
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:25,278
katakana

190
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:31,919
co. Imagine this character as a road

191
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,919
with two

192
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:40,120
corners. Now, do you remember what court

193
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:45,360
sounds like with a duck? It will be go

194
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:54,320
co go co go. Let's see all the

195
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:55,519
characters again. C G K G C G K K K K K

196
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,480
K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K G G G G G

197
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:02,159
G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G co

198
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,800
go. Now let's review what you've

199
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:09,199
learned. I show you a character or a

200
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,199
word and give you time to say them.

201
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,919
Ready? What? Which one is the katakana

202
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,079
k? It's this one. Just find a sideways

203
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:35,200
K. It has a duct ten so

204
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:43,679
it's remember it's a diagramraph so

205
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,679
don't say that e

206
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:48,879
sound as in mount

207
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:57,759
huji echo this means eco-friendly it's a

208
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,759
popular katakana word right

209
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:03,200
now gia it means gear

210
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:09,278
Here. Co. Caka means

211
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,680
caka. Cake. This is cake.

212
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,879
Yum. This is the sound crows

213
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:30,679
make. This means cool or sexy.

214
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,480
Goo. This is anomato pier for the sound

215
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,480
of snoring or stomach

216
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:44,518
grumbling. Okay. As you can guess, it

217
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,919
means

218
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:50,560
okay. Great job. Have you forgotten some

219
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:52,479
hiragana characters? Many katakana

220
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,719
characters look very similar to their

221
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,480
hiragana counterparts. So it will

222
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,399
actually take you less effort to

223
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,039
remember if you've mastered all the

224
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,120
hiragana already. So keep on reviewing

225
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,439
the hiragana characters even if we are

226
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,360
doing the katakana characters already.

227
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,920
Okay, let's wrap up this lesson by

228
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:16,480
recapping what you've learned. In this

229
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:23,278
lesson, you learned C and G, K and G, C

230
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:25,600
and G, K and G, and C and go.

231
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,919
You've now mastered 56 Japanese

232
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,399
characters. Hi everyone. Welcome to

233
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,240
basic Japanese writing. The fastest,

234
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,639
easiest, and most fun way to master the

235
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,639
Japanese

236
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,839
alphabet. You've learned these 10

237
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,680
katakana characters from the previous

238
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:46,880
lessons. In this lesson, you learn five

239
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:49,120
new katakana characters.

240
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:52,559
The first katakana character for this

241
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,560
lesson is

242
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:59,519
sa. This one looks like a

243
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:08,078
saddle and might get you confused. So to

244
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,879
differentiate the two, just look at

245
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:14,479
where the second and third strokes end.

246
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:18,320
The ones for s end at the center and the

247
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,639
ones for s end at the sides. All of the

248
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,600
characters in this column can also be

249
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,639
altered by a duct ten. Do you remember

250
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:33,320
what sa with the duct ten sounds like?

251
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:36,480
It's z sa z sa

252
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:39,480
z. Okay, next up is the kakana

253
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,480
character.

254
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,720
She try to think of she as a sinking

255
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:52,399
ship. Let's add a duct tan to she.

256
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,519
Remember, it's not supposed to sound

257
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,480
like Z. She with a duct tan is

258
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:05,278
pronounced as

259
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:08,879
G. She g she g. She is the only Japanese

260
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:11,039
character that produces the sh sound and

261
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:18,078
the only original Japanese syllable

262
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:21,120
sounds available are sha she sh and sh.

263
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:25,679
The diagraph sh is then created by

264
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:28,159
adding a small katakana e to sh. This

265
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:33,039
enables Japanese people to say words

266
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:35,278
like chef and share. Also, since she

267
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:38,240
with a duct ten is the only sound in

268
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:40,958
Japanese to produce a J sound, the same

269
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,440
is done to J, creating the J

270
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:48,198
diagramraph. This allows Japanese people

271
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:53,279
to say words like jelly or

272
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:53,278
widget. The third one is the katakana

273
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:01,879
s. Think of this one as a person skiing.

274
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:10,479
Let's add a duct t to s as well. It now

275
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,480
becomes

276
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:18,399
s. This is the katakana character.

277
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:27,198
Se katakana is also another character

278
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,078
that looks like an angular version of

279
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:33,679
its hiragana counterpart. It's also just

280
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,679
missing this part on the top

281
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:45,519
right. Let's modify set with a den. It

282
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:45,518
is now pronounced as z se

283
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:53,078
z. And our final character for this

284
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:56,078
lesson is the katakana.

285
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:56,078
So,

286
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:04,078
so to remember so just imagine it as a

287
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,078
soft served ice cream

288
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:11,798
cone. Now can you go and say what so

289
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:18,798
sounds like with the duct? It will

290
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:21,959
be so z so z. Let's see all the

291
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:24,439
characters again.

292
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:27,439
Z,

293
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,439
she

294
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:37,918
s J so Z and a new diagramraphs sh and

295
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:44,000
J. Now let's review what you've learned.

296
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:48,679
I'll show you a character or a word and

297
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,679
give you time to say them. Ready?

298
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:06,960
S. It's G. Which one is the

299
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:11,678
katakana? It's this

300
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:19,200
one. Oh, remember the opera

301
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,200
singer?

302
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:30,798
Oh, this refers to the gas in the gas

303
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:33,119
lines and not gasoline or the gas state

304
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:33,119
of

305
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:37,679
matter. This means

306
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:45,199
Asia

307
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:47,480
ski means skiing. Don't confuse it with

308
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,480
meaning to

309
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,480
like

310
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,798
ski. This means

311
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:04,799
co source. It means source or sometimes

312
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:14,558
source. Kasakasa. This is the Japanese

313
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,559
for wrestling. It also means

314
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:23,839
dry. Whiskey. This means whiskey. Japan

315
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:23,839
has a few well-known brands of

316
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:31,519
whiskey. This means to share. You can

317
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:32,678
actually find it in the Japanese

318
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,839
Facebook

319
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:37,919
sites. Great job. Did you know when you

320
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:40,558
ask for ice in the store, you wouldn't

321
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,280
actually get ice, but ice cream instead?

322
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,359
Japanese people tend to contract popular

323
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,359
long words. So, it's best to research

324
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:50,240
first before turning English words into

325
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:52,240
katakana words directly. Okay, let's

326
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,038
wrap up this lesson by recapping what

327
00:19:52,240 --> 00:20:03,120
you've learned. In this lesson, you

328
00:19:55,038 --> 00:20:08,960
learned Sa and Z, she and J, S and Z, S

329
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:11,558
and Z, so and Z, and the diagramraphs SH

330
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,880
and

331
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:17,440
J. You've now mastered 61 Japanese

332
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,080
characters. Hi everyone, welcome to

333
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,080
basic Japanese writing. The fastest,

334
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,558
easiest, and most fun way to master the

335
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:24,558
Japanese

336
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,679
alphabet. You've learned these 15

337
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:33,519
katakana characters from the previous

338
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:35,840
lessons. In this lesson, you learned the

339
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,759
five katakana characters under the T

340
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,000
column.

341
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:43,519
The first katakana character for this

342
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,519
lesson is

343
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,038
t. Think of it as a person holding a

344
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,480
tablet. Just like their hiragana

345
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:59,279
counterparts, all of the katakana in

346
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:05,919
this column can be altered by a duct as

347
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:05,918
well. Ta with a den is d

348
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,360
t. Okay. Next up is the

349
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:15,359
katakana

350
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:15,359
chi

351
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:21,759
chi. Try to imagine katakana chi as a

352
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:31,279
chicken. Now let's add a duct tan to ch.

353
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:36,400
Remember it's not pronounced D. Actually

354
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:37,480
chi with a duct is pronounced as G chi G

355
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,038
J G J G J G J G J G J G J G J G J G J G

356
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:45,038
ch G G just like its hiragana

357
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:47,960
counterpart G is very rarely used. Just

358
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:51,440
like she is the only sh sound in

359
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,679
Japanese, chi is the only one with a ch

360
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,000
sound in Japanese.

361
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,880
The only syllables that were originally

362
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,558
available are

363
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:04,799
cha ch and ch. So making the chat

364
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:08,759
diagramraph allows Japanese people to

365
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:11,440
say long words like chair or

366
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:14,720
actually. The third katakana for this

367
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,720
lesson is

368
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:22,839
t. T looks like a tuna fish's head.

369
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:30,079
Does Kataku remind you of Kataki? They

370
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,080
look very similar, don't they? Here's a

371
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,558
great way to figure out which one is

372
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:38,000
which. Just remember the strokes of

373
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:40,480
their hiragana counterpart. Hiragana

374
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,759
starts from the top and curves up at the

375
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,000
end. The two short lines of kataki

376
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,839
aligns with this part and both

377
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,759
characters ends by going

378
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:54,720
up on the other hand starts from the

379
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:57,759
left and curves down at the end. The two

380
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,400
short lines of kataku align with this

381
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:04,480
part and both characters ends by going

382
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:08,480
down instead. Okay, let's add a den to t

383
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:11,480
as well. It's pronounced as t. Listen

384
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,480
carefully.

385
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:20,240
Tai is also available for katakana as

386
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,519
well. It serves the same function of

387
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,798
lengthening the consonant after it when

388
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:28,960
found at the end of the word. The tu

389
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,679
acts like a glutter stop for words

390
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:36,079
spelled using

391
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:36,080
katakana. Next is the katakana character

392
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:44,798
T. Katakana looks like a telephone pole

393
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,798
bent at an

394
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,480
angle. Let's modify T with a duct ten.

395
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,480
It is now pronounced

396
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,480
as T T.

397
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:03,600
Since chi has the ch sound, the t column

398
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:06,319
doesn't have a native t syllable sound.

399
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,439
So for long words that have this sound,

400
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:11,759
the t diagramraph is

401
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:14,960
created. And since chi with a den is

402
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:16,960
pronounced g, a long word with the d

403
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,919
syllable on the other hand can be

404
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,519
written using the d

405
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:26,880
diagramraph. Our final character for

406
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,879
this lesson is the katakana to

407
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:32,720
to looks like a side view of a to

408
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:39,440
temple. What does to sound like with a

409
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:46,798
duct ten? To with a duct ten is

410
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:49,640
pronounced do. Remember to do to to do.

411
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:52,158
Just as there is no native T syllable in

412
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:55,038
Japanese, there isn't a native T

413
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:58,240
syllable as well. In order to say fallen

414
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:01,599
names or long words with a T syllable,

415
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,839
the T diagramraph is used. By adding a

416
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:07,038
duct tenant to the two diagramraph,

417
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:11,519
spell out words with the D syllable.

418
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:11,519
Let's see all the characters again.

419
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:28,480
T do and the new diagramraphs

420
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,159
ch to and

421
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:38,720
d. Now let's review what you've learned.

422
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:42,400
I'll show you a character or a word and

423
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,400
give you time to say them.

424
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,720
Ready

425
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:50,558
T

426
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:54,319
do

427
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:59,839
me. Which one is a

428
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,240
katakana? It's this one. Remember the

429
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:08,480
stroke of their hiragana counterparts

430
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,880
and you'll easily distinguish between

431
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,880
these

432
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:24,720
two

433
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,720
tai means

434
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,400
Thailand. It's

435
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,720
cheeseto this means a romantic

436
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,640
date is

437
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,480
Germany switch it means

438
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:56,399
switch this means soccer or football

439
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,400
goal

440
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,759
pool. Refers to outdoor

441
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:13,038
activities. This is what we call roller

442
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,759
coasters. Great job. Confused about how

443
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,879
to properly spell long words in

444
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:19,839
katakana? Searching in an online

445
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,000
dictionary is the best way to go. More

446
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:25,038
and more and foreign words are being

447
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,919
incorporated into Japanese and many even

448
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,919
have more than one accepted spelling.

449
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,320
Okay, let's wrap up this lesson by

450
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:39,320
recapping what you've learned. In this

451
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:46,399
lesson, you learned T and D, she and J,

452
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:46,399
T, D, and T, T

453
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:55,720
and the

454
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:59,480
diagramraphs, T, D, T, and

455
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:02,000
D. You've now mastered 66 Japanese

456
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,720
characters. Hi everyone. Welcome to

457
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,798
Basic Japanese Writing, the fastest,

458
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,278
easiest, and most fun way to master the

459
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:09,278
Japanese

460
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:16,200
alphabet. You've learned these 20

461
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:19,038
katakana characters in the previous

462
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,278
lessons. In this lesson, you learned the

463
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:23,359
five katakana characters of the N

464
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:25,519
column.

465
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,959
The first katakana character for this

466
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:30,960
lesson is

467
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,960
na

468
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,960
na. Think of na as a curved

469
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:43,038
knife. Okay, next up is the

470
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:53,519
katakana. Remember the hiragana.

471
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,120
Just remove this part and make the line

472
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,119
straight and you get the

473
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,200
katakana. The third one is the

474
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:11,440
katakana. Try to think of it as a

475
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:17,119
news. This is the katakana

476
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,240
character.

477
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,480
N. Think of N as a nest in a

478
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:32,918
tree. And our final character for this

479
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:35,918
lesson is the katakana.

480
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:35,919
No.

481
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:42,480
No. It's easy to remember this one. It's

482
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:46,839
a no sign just like its hiragana

483
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,839
counterpart but without the circle.

484
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:53,599
Let's see all the characters

485
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:53,599
again.

486
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,440
N. Now, let's review what you've

487
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:05,919
learned. I'll show you a character or a

488
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,919
word and give you time to say them.

489
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Ready? No.

490
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,440
me.

491
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:30,079
She s try not to confuse it

492
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:39,798
with po.

493
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:44,558
It's a tuna

494
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:52,080
fish. This is the material or punch line

495
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,080
of a

496
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,640
joke. This actually means

497
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:05,199
notebook. This refers to elderly

498
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,720
people. Canoe. It means canoe.

499
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,880
This means the

500
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:24,398
internet. This means smiling from ear to

501
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:33,200
ear. Designer. It means

502
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,798
designer. Great job. As you can see, so

503
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,600
many falling words end up being

504
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:39,519
translated using the katakana sy. and

505
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:42,158
you'll be tempted to just translate

506
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,319
English words directly all the time.

507
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,399
However, not all words catch on in

508
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:49,519
Japanese. Make sure to learn more

509
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:52,038
Japanese words first. Okay, let's wrap

510
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,880
up this lesson by recapping what you've

511
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:57,519
learned. In this lesson, you learned the

512
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,519
katakana

513
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,798
characters and

514
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:07,359
no, you've now mastered 71 Japanese

515
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,080
characters.

516
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:12,719
Hi everyone, welcome to basic Japanese

517
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:16,240
writing, the fastest, easiest, and most

518
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,240
fun way to master the Japanese

519
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:22,678
alphabet. You've learned these 25

520
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,440
katakana characters from the previous

521
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:27,278
lessons. In this lesson, you learned the

522
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,759
five katakana characters in the H

523
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:32,720
column. We'll be using the daken and

524
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:35,119
haken as well.

525
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,640
The first katakana character for this

526
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,639
lesson is

527
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:47,759
ha. To remember ha, imagine it as a roof

528
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:47,759
of a

529
00:32:48,599 --> 00:33:01,678
house. Do you remember how to pronounce

530
00:32:51,278 --> 00:33:04,880
ha with a den? It will be B h B h B. And

531
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,038
what will be its sound if we put a haken

532
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,840
on it

533
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:13,278
instead? Do you remember H with a haken

534
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:14,319
is pronounced P H P P P P P P P P P P P

535
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:15,278
P P P P P P P P P H H H H H H H H H H H

536
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:16,119
H H H H H H H H H H P P P P P P P P P P

537
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:19,200
P P P P P P P P P

538
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:22,199
P. Okay, next up is the katakana

539
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,200
character.

540
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:29,200
He can you see it as a side of

541
00:33:30,038 --> 00:33:38,119
heel? Now let's add a duct ten to

542
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:43,918
he with a duct ten is pronounced as b he

543
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:50,719
he b he he he b. And how will it sound

544
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:52,519
with a haken? It's going to be P he he p

545
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:57,000
he he he

546
00:33:52,519 --> 00:34:01,759
P. The third katakana for this lesson is

547
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:05,359
H. Remember it's not who or who but

548
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,359
somewhat in between. H

549
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:15,240
who to remember the katakana h try to

550
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,239
think of it as the tip of a foot.

551
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Let's try adding a duct t to h as well.

552
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:26,159
What do you think it will sound like?

553
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,159
It's pronounced as b. Listen carefully.

554
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,240
H b h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h

555
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,800
h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h

556
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,759
h h b

557
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:36,560
b. Now let's try it with haken. It

558
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,639
becomes P H P P P P P P P P P P P P P P

559
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,599
P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P

560
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,559
P P P P P P H H H H H H H H H H H H H H

561
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,000
H H H H H H H P P P P P P P P P P P P P

562
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:41,838
P P P P P P P P P H H H H H H H H H H H

563
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,918
H H H H H H H H H is special as it's the

564
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:46,960
only syllable in Japanese to have a

565
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:49,918
sound very close to an F sound. You

566
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:55,599
combine h with smaller versions of the

567
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:55,598
katakana vowels to make a whole f column

568
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:02,239
f

569
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:05,599
and take note that you don't combine a

570
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:07,199
small u to h since it already ends in an

571
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:11,519
sound.

572
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,519
Next is the katakana character

573
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:20,639
he looks exactly like it hilagana

574
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:20,639
counterpart with no

575
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:32,960
exceptions. Let's modify he with a den.

576
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:36,000
It is now pronounced as B he he b he B.

577
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:42,679
And when he is modified with a handm it

578
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:45,838
will be pronounced as P he p he he

579
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:49,519
p. Our final character for this lesson

580
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:49,519
is the katakana

581
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:58,480
h. You can think of H as a shining holy

582
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:08,000
cross. What does H sound like with a

583
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:09,079
duct? H with a duct is pronounced po h

584
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:16,519
po h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h

585
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:17,519
h po. And with a hand, it will be po h

586
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:21,358
po h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h

587
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:31,199
h po p po. Let's see all the characters

588
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:38,480
again. H B P He B P H B P P P P P P P P

589
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:41,239
P P P P P P P P P P P P He B P H B P and

590
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:45,320
the new diagramraphs

591
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:48,000
F P and

592
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:50,640
P. Now, let's review what you've

593
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,039
learned. I'll show you a character or a

594
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:55,039
word and give you time to say them.

595
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:00,239
Ready

596
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,400
P.

597
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,480
He what? Remember the white

598
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,400
swan?

599
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,480
B

600
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:29,199
C N. It looks like a knife.

601
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:37,279
Remember, this could mean bass, the

602
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:40,279
musical instrument or the vases in

603
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,280
baseball.

604
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:45,920
It means to slack

605
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,000
off. This means

606
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,559
coffee. This refers to department

607
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:05,199
store. Business. Business means

608
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:12,880
business. Party. This means party. Yeah.

609
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,920
Pika pika. This means shiny or

610
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:27,199
sparkling. Go. This is anomato for

611
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,200
rushing

612
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:33,519
water. Great job. Did you know that many

613
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:36,639
long words have become so popular that

614
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:38,599
they even become verbs or adjectives?

615
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:41,319
Some examples

616
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:45,440
are meaning to

617
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:48,640
share meaning smart looking and meaning

618
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,599
to slack off. This last one comes from

619
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,960
an abbreviation of

620
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:56,240
sabotage. Okay, let's wrap up this

621
00:38:52,960 --> 00:39:02,119
lesson by recapping what you've learned.

622
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:13,358
In this lesson, you learned ha ba and p

623
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:16,000
he b and p h b and p he b and p h h h h

624
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:20,199
h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h po and

625
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,199
po and the diagramraphs

626
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:23,199
f

627
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:30,078
and you've Now master 76 Japanese

628
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,559
characters. Hi everyone, welcome to

629
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,560
basic Japanese writing. The fastest,

630
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:37,039
easiest, and most fun way to master the

631
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:37,039
Japanese

632
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:43,239
alphabet. You've learned these sachi

633
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:46,000
katakana characters from the previous

634
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:49,118
lessons. In this lesson, you learn five

635
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,280
new katakana characters.

636
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,480
The first katakana character for this

637
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,480
lesson is

638
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,480
ma

639
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:02,078
ma. Think of ma as a manta

640
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:09,280
ray. Okay, next up is the katakana

641
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,280
character

642
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:18,119
me. To remember me, look for the line in

643
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,119
the middle.

644
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,519
The third one is the

645
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:25,519
katakana

646
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:31,039
m looks like a moose's

647
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:38,159
antlers. Could you tell m from m? Here's

648
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,960
an easy way to do it. Just look for the

649
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:44,000
horizontal line. If it's above, then

650
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,519
it's a m. And if it's under, then it's a

651
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,760
m.

652
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:49,759
This is the katakana character.

653
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:58,079
Me. Just draw a rectangle around it and

654
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,079
you got

655
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:06,399
male. And our final character for this

656
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:06,399
lesson is the katakana

657
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:14,400
mo. Mo looks very similar to its

658
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,639
hiragana counterpart. The only

659
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,559
difference is that the third stroke

660
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,559
doesn't intersect the first

661
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:29,119
one. Let's see all the characters again.

662
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:29,119
M

663
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:36,400
m. Now, let's review what you've

664
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,800
learned. I'll show you a character or a

665
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,800
word and give you time to say them.

666
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,800
Ready?

667
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,598
Which one is the

668
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,240
katakamu? It's this

669
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:03,880
one. It's the first character I taught

670
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,880
you. A

671
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:22,559
This means games including iPad and

672
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:22,559
video

673
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:30,480
games. Is the abbreviation and the more

674
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:33,480
common term to refer to a smartphone in

675
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,480
Japan.

676
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:40,159
Memor this means to take a memo or to

677
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,159
take

678
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:49,440
note. This actually refers to an

679
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:49,439
illustration as opposed to an actual

680
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:56,759
picture. It means digital camera.

681
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:05,199
Here's another abbreviation that means

682
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:05,199
mass communication or

683
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:14,559
media is an eraser. It literally means

684
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:14,559
erasing

685
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,400
rubber. This means

686
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:25,759
Mexico. Great job. As I've said before,

687
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,160
katakana is used to write phony words

688
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,880
and names. So, why don't you try and

689
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:32,399
write your name in the comments using

690
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,280
katakana? We can also help you with the

691
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,639
spelling since it can be tricky

692
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,359
sometimes. Okay, let's wrap up this

693
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:42,078
lesson by recapping what you've learned.

694
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:46,039
In this lesson, you learned the katakana

695
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:49,039
characters. Ma,

696
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:49,039
m,

697
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:55,200
and you've now mastered 81 Japanese

698
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,680
characters. Hi everyone, welcome to

699
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,679
Basic Japanese Writing, the fastest,

700
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:02,159
easiest, and most fun way to master the

701
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,159
Japanese

702
00:44:03,318 --> 00:44:08,838
alphabet. You've learned these 35

703
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:11,440
katakana characters from the previous

704
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:14,000
lessons. In this lesson, we are skipping

705
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,358
ahead to the R column where you'll learn

706
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,960
five new katakana

707
00:44:16,358 --> 00:44:22,838
characters. The first katakana character

708
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,838
for this lesson is

709
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:30,719
Try to think of la as a ling

710
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:37,440
chair. Next up is the

711
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,440
katakana.

712
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:48,358
Li le looks exactly like its hiragana

713
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:48,358
counterpart but without the honey part.

714
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:52,960
The third one is the

715
00:44:56,199 --> 00:45:03,279
katakana. To remember this character,

716
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:03,279
think of it as the roots of a

717
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:09,760
tree. This is the katakana character

718
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:17,960
le. Think of le as a razor blade.

719
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,800
And now our final character for this

720
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:26,800
lesson is the

721
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,800
katakana.

722
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:32,318
Lo looks like a robot's

723
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:37,599
mouth. Let's see all the characters

724
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,960
again.

725
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:48,640
L. Now let's review what you've learned.

726
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:53,318
I show you a character or a word and

727
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:53,318
give you time to say them. Ready?

728
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:09,838
L

729
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:13,679
go

730
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:27,439
m this means

731
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:34,400
hotel. Toilet. This means the toilet.

732
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,880
It's best to remember this one if you

733
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,880
are going to

734
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:44,800
Japan. TV. It means TV. As you can see,

735
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,800
it's short for

736
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,440
television. It's the popular Japanese

737
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,440
pastime.

738
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,000
is the United

739
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,560
Kingdom. It means part-time

740
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:13,358
work. This means to propose

741
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:21,279
marriage. This means credit card.

742
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:24,239
Japanese people wouldn't understand if

743
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,800
you just say card. So, make sure to say

744
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:26,799
the whole

745
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:32,159
thing. Great job. Do you know what the

746
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,799
ultimate flash card game for reading

747
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:37,358
hiragana and katakana is? Try doing

748
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,318
Japanese kok. You'll need to read the

749
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:41,838
characters first in order to sing

750
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:44,960
properly. I suggest starting with some

751
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:47,480
slow songs first. Okay, let's wrap up

752
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:52,800
this lesson by recapping what you've

753
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:52,800
learned. In this lesson, you learned

754
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,000
la

755
00:47:54,920 --> 00:48:00,159
and just like in the hiragana lesson,

756
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,159
please take note that we skipped the y

757
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:04,719
column this time so that we could

758
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:07,118
discuss all the Japanese diagramraphs in

759
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:07,118
the next

760
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:12,400
lesson. You've now mastered 86 Japanese

761
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:14,960
characters.

762
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,519
Hi everyone, welcome to basic Japanese

763
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,039
writing. The fastest, easiest, and most

764
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,039
fun way to master the Japanese

765
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:27,799
alphabet. You've learned these 40

766
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:30,480
katakana characters from the previous

767
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:32,480
lessons. In this lesson, you learned

768
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,480
three katakana characters in the Y

769
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,199
column and the rest of the diagramraphs

770
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,358
in katakana.

771
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:41,078
The first katakana character for this

772
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:44,078
lesson is

773
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:44,079
Ya.

774
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:50,799
Ya. Ya. Actually looks like its hilagana

775
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,599
counterpart, but a bit more angular and

776
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,599
without this

777
00:48:55,159 --> 00:49:01,838
stroke. This is the katakana character.

778
00:48:58,838 --> 00:49:01,838
You.

779
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:08,480
You. Imagine you as a periscope of a U

780
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,480
boat

781
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:17,039
underwater. Our final character for this

782
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,039
lesson is the katakana

783
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:25,240
y. It's like a yolk pulled by two oxen.

784
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:34,159
Just like in hiragana, diagraphs in

785
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:40,280
katakana are also formed by adding a

786
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:43,279
small ya yu or y to a consonant plus e

787
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:45,599
syllable. Remember, they are set for the

788
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:48,160
same duration as all the previous

789
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:50,800
syllables that you've learned. Pronounce

790
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:53,519
them by gliding to the y sound and do

791
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,559
not pronounce the e sound.

792
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:58,440
C

793
00:49:55,559 --> 00:50:01,440
Q

794
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,440
Y

795
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,639
sh

796
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:24,720
P me m me m me m me m me m me m me m me

797
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:24,719
m me m me m me m

798
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,400
Let's see all the characters again.

799
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,199
Yo, and the diagramraphs in

800
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:43,119
katakana. Now, let's review what you've

801
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:45,599
learned. I'll show you a character or a

802
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:48,599
word and give you time to say them.

803
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,599
Ready?

804
00:50:56,519 --> 00:51:03,000
Do he remember the smiling mouth going?

805
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,960
Da. This is the time table for buses and

806
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:30,639
trains. Menu. This means

807
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,760
menu. Ju. It's

808
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:42,079
juice. T-shirt. It means t-shirt.

809
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,280
Barbecue. This means

810
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:53,040
barbecue. Chocolate. This is

811
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,159
chocolate. This is a cat's meow in

812
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:09,760
Japanese. This refers to a bank

813
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:12,880
card. Great job. As I've said before,

814
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:16,640
Japanese uses three scripts, hiragana,

815
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:18,800
katakana, and kanji. However, recently

816
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:20,598
Japanese also started to make use of

817
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:24,160
Roman letters just like

818
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:26,599
in we even have the expression energy,

819
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:29,598
which is an abbreviation of no

820
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:32,480
good. Okay, let's wrap up this lesson by

821
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:34,440
recapping what you've learned. In this

822
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:39,679
lesson, you learned the katakana

823
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:42,159
characters ya y and y and all the

824
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:42,159
Japanese

825
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:48,358
diagramraphs. You've now mastered 89

826
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:51,279
Japanese characters. Only three left to

827
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:54,078
go. Hi everyone. Welcome to basic

828
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,160
Japanese writing. The fastest, easiest,

829
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:59,160
and most fun way to master the Japanese

830
00:52:56,159 --> 00:52:59,159
alphabet.

831
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,960
[Music]

832
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:05,000
You've learned these 43 katakana

833
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,920
characters from the previous

834
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,639
lessons. In this lesson, you learned the

835
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:14,480
last three characters in basic Japanese

836
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:18,400
writing. The first katakana character

837
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,400
for this lesson is

838
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:27,239
W. This character looks like a wine

839
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:27,239
glass.

840
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:35,760
Katakana and W looks similar, doesn't

841
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:38,519
it? Well, just remember that W is wider

842
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:41,760
and C has more curved

843
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:43,719
lines. Okay, next up is the katakana

844
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:48,880
character

845
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:48,879
W. It is also commonly said as

846
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:59,039
O. To remember katakana, try to think of

847
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:59,039
it as part of the world Olympic torch.

848
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:04,960
Our final collector for this lesson is

849
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:04,959
the

850
00:54:07,639 --> 00:54:13,679
katakana. It looks like a spacecraft

851
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,679
entering the Earth's

852
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:21,680
atmosphere. Many people confuse so and

853
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,760
because they look very similar. One

854
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:27,118
thing that could help distinguish the

855
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:29,599
two is that so is slimmer.

856
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:32,240
Just like the hiragana, you can never

857
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:34,318
start a word with a katakana. It can

858
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:35,399
only be found in the middle or at the

859
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:39,279
end of

860
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:41,760
words. Again, just like in hiragana, the

861
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,680
pronunciation of n varies a bit

862
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:47,359
depending on the syllable that comes

863
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:51,480
after it. It sounds like an M sound when

864
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:56,480
it comes before a b or p sound. For

865
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:59,599
example, haga and camp. It can also

866
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:03,000
sound like an N sound when it comes

867
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:07,640
before a G sound like

868
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:12,559
in. Let's say all the characters again.

869
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:12,558
W or O. And

870
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:18,159
finally, now let's review what you've

871
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,640
learned. I'll show you a character or a

872
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:22,318
word and give you time to say them.

873
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:25,199
Ready?

874
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:25,199
Which one is the

875
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:29,599
katak? It's this

876
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:41,039
one. Just like a tsunami. Which one is

877
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,039
the

878
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:47,720
katakana? It's this one. The wider one.

879
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:06,559
This means convenience store. You'll

880
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:06,558
find a lot of them in

881
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:13,599
Japan. Why? This is an onomato pier for

882
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,599
a noisy

883
00:56:14,358 --> 00:56:21,039
crowd. Air. This means AC or air

884
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:28,400
conditioning. It's lame. It's a famous

885
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,400
noodles and soup dish in

886
00:56:29,239 --> 00:56:34,798
Japan. One, this is a dog's bark in

887
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,798
Japanese. This means a gift.

888
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:48,239
This actually refers to contact

889
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:56,400
lenses. This is a general term for men

890
00:56:53,838 --> 00:57:00,119
working for a company. They are mostly

891
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:03,119
distinguished by their shirt and nexai

892
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:05,880
attire. Great job. There's actually a

893
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:08,640
very fun word game in Japanese

894
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,559
called. Basically, one person says a

895
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:12,719
word and the next person says another

896
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:15,440
word which starts with the last syllable

897
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:18,000
of the word said by the previous person.

898
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,798
But remember, no Japanese word starts

899
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,679
with N. So, anyone who gives a word

900
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:25,440
ending with it

901
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:28,318
loses. Okay, let's wrap up this lesson

902
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:32,480
by recapping what you've learned. In

903
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:32,480
this lesson, you learned the katakana

904
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:35,599
characters

905
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:42,798
and you've now mastered all 92 hiragana

906
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,798
and katakana

907
00:57:44,679 --> 00:57:49,679
characters. Here are the 46 katakana

908
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:52,318
characters. They are the exact

909
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:54,960
equivalent of the 46 hiragana

910
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:58,358
characters. But I used to write most

911
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:01,119
country names, foreign names, long

912
00:57:58,358 --> 00:58:04,239
words, sounds and technical or

913
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:07,119
scientific words. They are also used to

914
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:09,199
indicate emphasis. These are the five

915
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:11,680
vowel sounds and the rest are

916
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:15,439
combination of a consonant and a vowel

917
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:19,199
sound except for n. A long vowel sound

918
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:22,400
in katakana is signified by a noash

919
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:25,679
instead of another vowel calixa. On the

920
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:28,400
other hand, the den or tenten mark is

921
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:30,679
used the same way in katakana to signify

922
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:33,358
that the consonant of the syllable is

923
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:38,239
voiced. It can modify the characters

924
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:41,679
under the k, s, t, and h columns. Unique

925
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:44,959
to katakana, the daken is also used with

926
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:49,440
the character u in order to signify the

927
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:51,838
letter v. The haken or maru mark which

928
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:54,318
makes the consonant sound plusive is

929
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:57,279
also used and it's unique to the h

930
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:59,599
column as well. There are more unique

931
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,359
diagramraphs in katakana to accommodate

932
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:04,680
the sounds from foreign words. This

933
00:59:02,358 --> 00:59:08,719
include

934
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:08,719
y we

00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:35,599
small ya yu or y to a consonant plus e

941
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:37,838
syllable just like in hilagana.

942
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:40,000
Pronunciation of katakana characters

943
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:41,719
doesn't change except for the following

944
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,400
with alternate

945
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:48,078
pronunciations. W is actually more

946
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:51,079
commonly pronounced as o and n can

947
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:53,839
sometimes be pronounced n

948
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:56,559
or depending on the syllable that comes

949
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:56,558
after it.
