# Grammar

Once you're comfortable with both hiragana and katakana, the essential next phase is to build a solid foundation in grammar, while progressively expanding your vocabulary and starting basic kanji study.  
Grammar is the framework of a language, including the rules for how words are formed, arranged into sentences, and how they convey meaning. It governs word order, punctuation, verb forms, and other structures, acting as a system that helps ensure messages are clear and understood by others.


## Particles
Japanese particles are small words that indicate relations of words within a sentence.


### **は (wa)**
は (wa) follows the topic the speaker wants to talk about. Therefore, wa（は）is often called topic marking particle. The “topic” is often the grammatical subject, but can be anything (including the grammatical object, and sometimes the verb), and it may also follow some other particles.

**Formation:** [ A ] wa [ B ] desu. => [ A ] is [ B ]

**Example:**
昨日は雨だった。
Kinō wa ame datta.
It was rainy yesterday

***

### **を (o)**
を (o) follows the noun that is the direct object of a transitive verb. It is a very common particle that indicates the word preceding it is the object of the sentence.

**Formation:** [ Noun ] wo [ Verb ]

**Example:**
リンゴを食べた。
Ringo o tabeta.
I ate an apple.

***

### **も (mo)**
も (mo) means “also” or “too.” It replaces the particles が (ga), は (wa), or を (o) when indicating that the subject or object of a sentence is “also” doing something or is “also” something.

**Formation:** [ Noun ] mo [ Noun ] desu. => [ Noun ] is also [ Noun ]

**Example:**
私も学生です。
Watashi mo gakusei desu.
I am a student too.

***

### **に (ni)**
に (ni) is a location particle that can indicate a place towards which a person or thing moves. It also marks the location of existence with the verbs いる (iru) and ある (aru), which mean "to exist" or "to be."

**Formation:** [ Place ] ni [ Verb ]

**Example:**
日本に行きます。
Nihon ni ikimasu.
I am going to Japan.

***

### **へ (e)**
へ (e) is pronounced “e” and also marks a destination. It is similar to に (ni), but focuses more on the direction of movement rather than the arrival point.

**Formation:** [ Place ] e [ Verb ]

**Example:**
駅へ行く。
Eki e iku.
I am going toward the station.

***

### **で (de)**
で (de) is a particle that marks the location where an action takes place. It is often translated as “in,” “at,” or “on.”

**Formation:** [ Place ] de [ Verb ]

**Example:**
レストランで食べる。
Resutoran de taberu.
I will eat at a restaurant.

***

### **が (ga)**
が (ga) is a subject-marking particle. While は (wa) marks the topic of a sentence, が (ga) marks the grammatical subject, especially when it is being introduced for the first time or when the subject is being emphasized.

**Formation:** [ Subject ] ga [ Adjective ] desu.

**Example:**
犬が好きです。
Inu ga suki desu.
I like dogs. (Lit. Dogs are liked by me)

***

### **から (kara)**
から (kara) indicates the starting point of an action or object, and is translated as “from” or “since.”

**Formation:** [ Starting Point ] kara [ Ending Point ] made.

**Example:**
東京から来ました。
Tōkyō kara kimashita.
I came from Tokyo.

***

### **まで (made)**
まで (made) indicates the end point or limit of an action or state. It is the opposite of から (kara) and means “until” or “to.”

**Formation:** [ Starting Point ] kara [ Ending Point ] made.

**Example:**
朝まで勉強する。
Asa made benkyō suru.
I will study until morning.

***

### **と (to)**
と (to) is used to list nouns exhaustively, similar to “and” in English. It can also be used to indicate who you are with ("with") or to introduce a direct quote.

**Formation:** [ Noun A ] to [ Noun B ]

**Example:**
私と妹。
Watashi to imōto.
My sister and I.

***

### **や (ya)**
や (ya) is used to list nouns in a non-exhaustive manner, suggesting there are other things not mentioned. It can be translated as “and so on” or “things such as.”

**Formation:** [ Noun A ] ya [ Noun B ]

**Example:**
ケーキやパンを買った。
Kēki ya pan o katta.
I bought things like cake and bread.

***

### **の (no)**
の (no) is a particle used to show possession, similar to the English apostrophe-S ('s). It also modifies nouns by connecting them to other nouns.

**Formation:** [ Noun A ] no [ Noun B ] => [ Noun B ] belongs to [ Noun A ]

**Example:**
私の本。
Watashi no hon.
My book.

***

### **ね (ne)**
ね (ne) is a sentence-ending particle that is used to seek confirmation from the listener, similar to English tag questions like “right?” or “isn’t it?”

**Formation:** [ Sentence ] ne.

**Example:**
寒いですね。
Samui desu ne.
It's cold, isn't it?

***

### **よ (yo)**
よ (yo) is a sentence-ending particle that indicates the speaker is providing new information or expressing a strong conviction. It adds a sense of emphasis or certainty to the statement.

**Formation:** [ Sentence ] yo.

**Example:**
日本語を勉強しますよ。
Nihongo o benkyō shimasu yo.
I will study Japanese, I tell you.
