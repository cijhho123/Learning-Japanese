            <p>
                This is a short grammar primer. This is not intended to be a comprehensive guide. Each grammar structure
                can have dozens of different uses. We only teach the most common to get you started. If the explanation
                here doesn’t explain a usage in your immersion, don’t worry about it.
            </p>

            <h2 class="western">Mindset</h2>
            <h3 class="western">Memorizing grammar does not work</h3>
            <p>
                Languages are big. Each language has thousands of different patterns you need to learn in order to speak
                naturally. These patterns are called "grammar."
            </p>
            <p>
                Most grammar guides focus on teaching you how to speak by translating from English to Japanese. However,
                Japanese is so different from English, you would need to learn hundreds of grammar rules to speak
                correctly. Trying to follow all of these rules leads to very slow, awkward, and unnatural Japanese.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead, we focus on understanding the language first. You don’t need to learn the complex translation
                rules. You just need to understand grammar in context. When you can understand Japanese, you build an
                instinct for the grammar rules, just like you have in your native language.

            <blockquote>
                <em
                    >“You can’t learn anything new, until you are open enough to forget everything you think you
                    know”</em
                >
                <i>— James Victore</i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The first step to learning Japanese is to forget everything you think you know about how language works.
                Japanese is so different from other languages, any attempt to relate it to your native language just
                leads to frustration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keep an open mind and don’t worry about “why” Japanese works the way it does. Every language has quirks
                and inconsistencies, including your native language. You just don’t notice because you’re so used to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now you need to get used to Japanese. Accept the language as it is instead of wishing it was easier or
                different, and you’ll develop the same instincts you have in your native language.
            </p>
            <h3 class="western">How to use this guide</h3>
            <p>
                Do not try to memorize this guide or drill grammar rules. You don’t learn grammar from reading a guide.
                Grammar is learned by seeing real language used in real context.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of this guide is to show you basic grammar concepts, so you can notice them in your
                immersion. To use this guide effectively:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Read through the guide once. If things don’t make sense, don’t force yourself to understand.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        As you immerse in real Japanese, look for the concepts taught in this grammar guide. When you
                        see grammar in your immersion, refer back to this guide to understand it better. You don’t need
                        to refer back constantly. Don’t linger and don’t

            <h2 class="western">The Predicate</h2>
            <h3 class="western">Why Japanese is Hard</h3>
            <p>
                You may have learned in English class that sentence fragments are “incorrect” English. In Japanese,
                they’re the normal way to talk.
            </p>
            <p>
                The subject of the sentence (who the sentence is about) is usually dropped in Japanese. To understand
                who the sentence is about, you need to infer (guess) based on context.
            </p>
            <p>Because there’s often no subject, the core of the sentence is the “predicate”.</p>
            <h3 class="western">Predicates &amp; Particles</h3>
            <p><strong>What is a predicate?</strong></p>
            <p>The predicate of a sentence tells you what the subject does or what happens to the subject.</p>
            <p>Example: “Billy is a chef”</p>
            <p>Subject: Billy</p>
            <p>Predicate: “is a chef”</p>
            <p><strong>Main Predicates</strong></p>
            <p>There are 3 main types of predicates we are going to look at:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>

                            ><font><span lang="ja">い</span></font></font
                        >-adjectives
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Verbs</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Noun Sentences (Noun +
                        <font face="Noto Serif CJK JP"
                            ><font><span lang="ja">だ</span></font></font
                        >)
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Particles - Connecting to the Subject</strong></p>
            <p>
                Particles are markers made up of 1 or 2 kana that explain the relationship between the predicate and the
                other parts of the sentence. Each of the following is a different particle:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <font face="Noto Serif CJK JP"
                    ><font
                        ><span lang="ja"
                            ><strong>が・を・で・に・は・も・と・や・か・の・から・まで・ね・よ</strong></span
                        ></font
                    ></font
                >
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Each particle means something different and describes a different relationship between the parts of the
                sentence.
            </p>
            <p>
                We’ll teach a few particles alongside each predicate so you can see real examples that build on each
                other.

            </h3>
            <p><strong>What’s an Adjective?</strong></p>
            <p>
                An adjective describes a noun. In the sentence “The delicious food”, “delicious” is the adjective
                because it describes an attribute of the food.
            </p>
            <p>
                Japanese has two types of adjectives:

            <h3 class="western">The Verb Predicate</h3>
            <p>
                Verb predicates are easier for English speakers to wrap their heads around. Just like in English, there
                is a “dictionary form” of the verb and various conjugations.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, there are many more conjugations in Japanese than in English and these conjugations can be
                stacked on top of each other.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The Dictionary Form</strong></p>
            <p>
                The dictionary form is very similar to the “to” form of verbs in English. To look up a Japanese verb in
                a dictionary, you’ll need to remove its conjugations and convert it to its dictionary form.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example:
                <font face="Noto Serif CJK JP"
                    ><font><span lang="ja">教える </span></font></font
                >= “To teach”
            </p>
            <p>
                The dictionary form can refer to two different tenses: general and future. You’ll need to infer which
                one based on context.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example:
                <font face="Noto Serif CJK JP"
                    ><font><span lang="ja">ジョンが教える </span></font></font
                >= “Jon teaches” or “Jon will teach”

            <h2 class="western"><strong>Verb Conjugation - More Than Tense</strong></h2>
            <p>
                In English, we only conjugate verbs to show when they happened. In Japanese, there are A LOT more types
                of conjugations:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Tense</li>
                <li>Potentiality</li>
                <li>Politeness level</li>
                <li>Status and relationship</li>
                <li>Negation</li>
                <li>Causation</li>
                <li>Conditionals</li>
                <li>Plus More</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="western"><strong>Recognize. Don’t Memorize.</strong></h3>
            <p>
                It’s too complicated to try and memorize all these different conjugations. Instead, focus your efforts
                on learning to recognize and understand the patterns. After hundreds of hours of immersing in Japanese,
                you’ll develop an instinct for how and when each conjugation is used.
            </p>
            <h3 class="western"><strong>Regular Verb Conjugations</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Most Japanese verbs have a stem and are considered “Regular Verbs”. Here are some examples of “Regular
                Verbs” in their root (dictionary) form:

            <p>The red part of the words above are the “Verb stems” and they don’t change during conjugation.</p>
            <p>
                There are many different patterns for how to conjugate verbs, but most of them are predictable once you
                experience them in immersion.

            <p><strong>Past tense conjugations</strong></p>
            <p>
                Past tense conjugations express things that have already happened. The key to identifying past tense
                conjugations is that they end in
                <font face="Noto Serif CJK JP"

                >because the copula does not attach to verbs.

            <h3 class="western"><strong>Conjugating Sounds</strong></h3>
            <p>
                In the previous conjugations, we simply chop off the last character and attach the new conjugation to
                the stem. The next 3 conjugation patterns are more tricky.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of chopping off the ending, we modify it to make it sound different. That means, there will be a
                different hiragana than in the root form. Instead of looking for a specific hiragana, listen for the
                sound instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, we may ask you to listen for the
                <font face="Noto Serif CJK JP"
                    ><font><span lang="ja">え </span></font></font
                >sound. That means that the last character of the root form will change into
                <font face="Noto Serif CJK JP"
                    ><font><span lang="ja">め</span></font></font
                >,
                <font face="Noto Serif CJK JP"
                    ><font><span lang="ja">け</span></font></font
                >,
                <font face="Noto Serif CJK JP"
                    ><font><span lang="ja">れ</span></font></font
                >,
                <font face="Noto Serif CJK JP"
                    ><font><span lang="ja">せ </span></font></font
                >etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don’t try to memorize and produce these sound-based conjugations. Just look for them in your immersion.
                Even if you are reading, you can “listen” for these sounds in your head. Over time, you’ll develop an
                instinct for them.

            <p>
                The grammar points described in this guide should be enough to get you started with Japanese. As you
                immerse, refer back to this guide often until you can recognize and understand these grammar points in
                your immersion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember, this guide is just the basics of Japanese grammar. Once you have that foundation, move on to a
                <a href="https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/resources.html#grammar" target="_blank"
                    >full grammar reference guide</a
                >.
            </p>
            <h1 class="western"><strong>Quick Reference</strong></h1>
            <p>
                Don’t worry about mastery or memorizing. Browse casually daily and pair with a healthy immersion
                schedule and this will all solidify in time. Japanese is very different from English (and most other
                languages) so things will require time, patience, and exposure to feel comfortable. It’s completely
                normal to feel lost at times, that will fade away in time.
