            <p>The Japanese language is awesome.</p>
            <p>
                It also has one of the highest learning curves for (popular) modern languages, probably only rivaled by
                Chinese and English. It's especially hard for Westerners who don't know any Eastern languages already,
                since the way of thinking that Japanese relies on is just so alien to them.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                At the same time, there are a lot of people, like me, who passionately consume one or more facets of
                Japan's pop culture (arguably a menagerie of worldwide cult hits). This translates into droves of people
                with a strong personal desire to learn the language.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                So, I've been studying Japanese in one form or another for over five years now, and I've spent at least
                two of those years doing amateur translations of visual novels and trying to help others learn the
                language themselves.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                Here are a few of my favorite things about Japanese as a language: It looks and sounds beautiful, it's
                extremely intuitive (once you're fluent), its lexicon has several precise but abstract words English
                lacks, there are countless ways of expressing one's mood or personality or relationship to others
                without rephrasing anything, and virtually anything can be left implied so you never have to mince
                words.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                The corresponding downsides include an insane learning curve (half the pros I just listed are confusing
                as hell to most Westerners), a ton of homophones, and an incredibly high reliance on context.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                <u> Why this guide? </u>
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                Most books intended to help someone learn a foreign language are quite useless. Often, this is because
                few people actually want to put in the time and effort to properly learn a language, so the only way to
                write a book that appeals to them is to present very simplisitic and incomplete material. Other times,
                it comes down to the fact that teaching a language is very hard to do, and cannot be taught the same way
                most school subjects are.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                There are a number of serious but painfully common mistakes made as a result of trying to teach
                languages like an ordinary subject. The big one is that they never expect you to use a dictionary and
                "source material" (e.g., an actual book written in Japanese) to gain experience with the language.
                Instead, many classes and books will try to build your vocabulary using lists (often with misleadingly
                simple definitions) and teach you grammar via snowclones (e.g., "_
                <span lang="ja"> „Å´ </span>
                _
                <span lang="ja"> „ÇíË®Ä„ÅÜ </span>
                " means "to tell _ that _"), which can only ever hope to cover the simplest of sentences.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                Of course, it doesn't have to be as bad as I made it sound in the last paragraph. Tae Kim's guide, for
                instance, does a pretty good job keeping these disadvantages to a minimum. Still, in my opinion, being
                newbie-friendly is worth sacrificing in order to provide information that's as close to being genuinely
                accurate and comprehensive as possible. And that's what I tried to do.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                The upshot of this is that my guide expects you to put a lot of effort into studying Japanese, and in
                return you can trust it to never use any misleading simplifications or omit anything you need to know.
                In theory, this guide covers
                <i> everything </i>
                you need to know about Japanese, other than what you'll find in a dictionary or get a feel for just by
                reading for years yourself.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                Some people absolutely love this approach. Others find it intimidating and might be better off using a
                guide like Tae Kim's until they feel more confident. It's absolutely fine if you want to do that, as
                long as you are aware that such guides cannot avoid some amount of oversimplification or incompleteness
                in order to be that approachable, so take their lists and/or explanations with a grain of salt. And of
                course, there's no reason you can't use my guide in conjunction with others.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                Incidentally, my main goal for improving this guide in the future (aside from adding more random entries
                to
                <a href="CV.html"> Confusing Vocabulary </a>
                ) is to try and make it a little more newbie-friendly without sacrificing the informational content. For
                this version, I've added some pages that dissect some source material for you, which should make things
                less intimidating.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                <u> How do I study Japanese using this guide? </u>
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                Like most langauges, you must learn the Japanese alphabets (kana) first. There is absolutely no point
                attempting to do anything else until you have memorized them. As you might expect, reading the
                <a href="Alphabets.html"> Alphabets </a>
                page will help, since it contains a lot of other random information you ought to know in addition to
                simply what sound each kana corresponds to. It also has material on the kanji, but it's entirely up to
                you whether you want to study the kanji right after the kana or put them off for later (I expect most
                people will prefer to put them off for a while).
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                After that, you need to get a dictionary, some kind of source material, and a translation for it.
                First-timers should try using the source material dissections included in this guide, though I don't
                know how long those will last you. The meat of the guide is composed of these four pages:
                <a href="Particles.html"> Grammar Part 1: Particles </a>
                ,
                <a href="Vocab.html"> Essential Vocabulary </a>
                ,
                <a href="Conjugation.html"> Grammar Part 2: Conjugation </a>
                and
                <a href="Clauses.html"> Grammar Part 3: Clauses </a>
                . Start by reading as much of the first page as you can digest in one sitting, then look for the stuff
                it talked about in your chosen source material.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                Intially, this means looking for particles in random sentences and figuring out how they're being used.
                You will not be able to understand the vast majority of the text, but that's fine. Just look up some of
                the words in the simpler sentences, try to identify the particles around them, guess what they're doing,
                and compare against the translation to see how much you got right.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                The idea is that after a while, you get a feel for basic particles, so then you can move on to reading
                material further in the guide, then trying to apply those new ideas to the source material again. After
                a few weeks, you should be starting to look at common pronouns and transition words. After a few months,
                you should be looking primarily at verb forms. After several months, you should have very little trouble
                with simple sentences and be focusing your efforts on ones with multiple clauses. This process is
                definitely slow at first, but over time you'll be amazed at how much your fluency accelerates.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                Moreover, if you ever want to learn any language, you will have to do something like this eventually.
                There's no way around that. However, there are a lot of resources you can use to get a "headstart" on
                grasping certain aspects of the language. For instance, Rosetta Stone is a good headstart for
                understanding the particles (and some basic vocabulary), and Heisig's Remembering the Kanji is a good
                headstart for mnemonically memorizing kanji shapes and meanings. Using stuff like this can be a very
                good idea, as long as you're aware that they are only headstarts and should never be treated as
                authoritative references or teaching methods (in particular, anyone who thinks that you can use RtK to
                "learn all the kanji" is deluded).
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                The other pages in the guide are all some kind of supplement with no particular order or structure, and
                it really doesn't matter when you read them or what you do with them. But do check them out at some
                point.

                <u> Source Material </u>
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                ‚ÄúSource material‚Äù is a term I use to refer to anything created in a given language, by a native speaker
                of that language, and intended for use by other native speakers of that language. Depending on your
                location, budget, and attitudes towards legality, you may wish to travel to a Japantown and buy
                something in person, mail order something online, or download/pirate stuff from the internet. This guide
                and I will always assume you are attempting to read Japanese source material on a regular basis
                (regardless of how much of it you can actually understand). Important things to keep in mind when
                choosing your first source material (that isn't part of this guide):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>it must have furigana (tiny kana written above every kanji)</li>
                <li>you must have a good translation of the material to compare against</li>
                <li>
                    in general, dramas or plot-driven stories are significantly easier to learn from than romance or
                    character-driven stories (since they use more abstract words), and vastly easier to learn from than
                    comedy (which requires instant comprehension to be funny)
                </li>
                <li>avoid anything likely to use heavy slang, thick accents, classical language, etc.</li>
                <li>above all else, you should enjoy reading the translated version</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                For most people I know, the ideal first source material will be a manga series serialized in the Shonen
                Jump magazine.

                <u> Introduction to the Three Japanese Alphabets </u>
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                One of the most unique aspects of the Japanese language is that it can use up to three different
                alphabets at the same time. I think it's worth giving you at least a skeletal understanding of the way
                they interact before making you seriously study them.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                The three Japanese alphabets are called hiragana, katakana and kanji. The kana (hiragana and katakana
                together) are phonograms, just like the English alphabet. The kanji are ideograms, and are in many ways
                analogous to Greek and Latin roots in English.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                There are 71 hiragana, 71 katakana, and between 2,000 and 50,000 kanji depending on who you ask.
                Hiragana and katakana have a perfect one-to-one relationship (i.e., every hiragana has one corresponding
                katakana which represents the same sound, and vice versa). Hiragana are used constantly, so they will be
                your first priority. Katakana are used primarily for loanwords and miscellaneous aesthetic purposes, so
                they're less common. Kanji are used most of the time, although technically they're always optional, so
                conventions on whether to write a word in kanji or hiragana vary significantly. Also, there are several
                words which have no kanji.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                Most words are written one of three ways: kana only, kanji only, or kanji followed by hiragana. In the
                third case, the hiragana that follow are called okurigana. Kanji, as ideograms, tend to embody the
                meaning of a word, while the exact word being used may be specified and then inflected using okurigana.
            </p>

            <p>
                The words written only in hiragana here are pretty easy.
                <span lang="ja"> „Åì„ÅÆ </span>
                means ‚Äúthis/these,‚Äù and
                <span lang="ja"> „Åß„Åô </span>
                is a polite way of ending a sentence. The katakana word
                <span lang="ja"> „Çµ„É≥„Éó„É´ </span>
                is a simple loanword, exactly as easy as the romaji make it look. The first kanji here‚Äî
                <span lang="ja"> Êñá </span>
                ‚Äîis representing the word ‚Äúbun (sentence)‚Äù by itself. When you're more familiar with common particles
                (see document 2b), it will be naturally obvious to you that the letter
                <span lang="ja"> „ÅØ </span>
                is a particle (marking the subject of the sentence) rather than okurigana, and thus that
                <span lang="ja"> Êñá </span>
                is meant to be read alone. The second kanji‚Äî
                <span lang="ja"> Ê∑± </span>
                ‚Äîis the beginning of the word
                <span lang="ja"> Ê∑±„ÅÑ </span>
                fukai (deep). The
                <span lang="ja"> „ÅÑ </span>
                i has been changed to
                <span lang="ja"> „Åè </span>
                ku to indicate a change from adjective to adverb. Again, once you're more familiar with this sort of
                thing, it will be naturally obvious that the
                <span lang="ja"> „Åè </span>
                is okurigana for
                <span lang="ja"> Ê∑± </span>
                . The third kanji‚Äî
                <span lang="ja"> ËÄÉ </span>
                ‚Äîis the beginning of the word
                <span lang="ja"> ËÄÉ„Åà„Çã </span>
                kangaeru (to think), which has been heavily conjugated (see document 3). The
                <span lang="ja"> „Å™„ÅÑ </span>
                indicates a negative form (‚Äúdon't‚Äù), the
                <span lang="ja"> „Åß </span>
                indicates a connective form allowing more to be added, and the
                <span lang="ja"> ‰∏ã„Åï„ÅÑ </span>
                is an additional form meaning ‚Äúplease.‚Äù Notice that it also starts with a kanji but has a few okurigana.

                    v2.3 (07/27/2012) - I added some new pages with "BDT dissections" of source material (manga from
                    j-comi), converted the four sections of example sentence tables in the main guide to the BDT format
                    (thanks to Rinali for this suggestion), and revised the intro/contents/etc pages accordingly. Also
                    added the -garu form to Conjugation.html (I could've sworn I'd done that before...), and added
                    primitive backend hit counters so I can see which pages get more visits from now on.

                    v2.2 (06/16/2012) - The main addition is an Old Japanese page (far better than the 5/28 draft) which
                    covers all the same topics as the main guide, but in the context of old japanese. The Persistent
                    Kogo section in AGT has been revised accordingly. I also broke up the miscellaneous conjugation
                    details section, distributing its information into other sections where it fit better, and made the
                    html code a lot less bloated. Minor additions include: -i sokoneru compound verb,
