                As the title implies, this is just a short list of things I think are worth listing or explaining, but
                don't really fit in anywhere else. At the moment it's extremely short, so there's almost certainly
                something obvious I've forgotten to include, on top of the fact that I don't know very much about
                non-Kantou dialects yet (though as of v2.3 my kogo knowledge is decent).

                There are very, very few phrasal verbs in Japanese, so what follows is probably close to a comprehensive
                list.

            <p>
                Several Japanese words have a very specific formal (and longer) synonym, as shown below. For some
                reason, most of the “ru” verbs below have an irregular -i form ending in “i” not “ri,” which even
                doubles as a soft command. So, expect to see a fair amount of <span lang="ja">らっしゃい</span>,
                <span lang="ja">下さい</span> and the like.

            <p>
                <span lang="ja">古語</span> kogo is a general term for old forms of Japanese, in contrast with modern
                Japanese. As of version v2.2, there's a supplemental page <a href="OJ.html">all about it</a> since, like
                many other languages, learning a little about old Japanese helps with understanding modern Japanese.
                This is partly because it helps explain a lot of the modern language's quirks, but also because most
                native speakers know a few things about old Japanese and are thus prone to using them even in otherwise
                modern Japanese. The goal here is to list those things, so you can avoid getting thrown off by them even
                if you don't care about learning old Japanese.
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p>
                Before I can simply list all the bits worth knowing, there is one grammar detail that needs explaining.
                In old Japanese, instead of a single infinitive/nonpast form, there was a separate "predicative form"
                for verbs/adjectives meant to end a sentence, and an "attributive form" for verbs/adjectives at the end
                of a clause/phrase meant to describe a noun. The predicative form is the default/infinitive/dictionary
                form.
            </p>

            <p></p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    All adjectives end in <span lang="ja">し</span> in their predicative form, and either
                    <span lang="ja">き</span> or <span lang="ja">かる</span> in their attributive form. Thus it's quite
                    common to see adjectives ending in <span lang="ja">き</span> for no apparent reason. This is also
                    why <span lang="ja">ない</span> can become <span lang="ja">なし</span> or
                    <span lang="ja">なき</span>, and <span lang="ja">いい</span>/<span lang="ja">よい</span> can be
                    <span lang="ja">よし</span>. Adjectives also have a command form ending in -are, though so far
                    <span lang="ja">なかれ</span> is the only use of this I've seen in modern Japanese.
                </li>

                <li>
                    The old negative form is -a/-i -zu. Its attributive form is either -zaru or -nu, and its -i form is
                    either -zari or -zu. That is pretty confusing, but all you need to remember is that
                    -zu/-zari/-zaru/-nu are all old ways of indicating negation that modern speakeres may still use.
                    <br />-zu is often used just like -nai, but it can also be used with the
                    <span lang="ja">に</span> particle in a way that's best translated using the word "without".
                    <br />-zaru is mainly used in the expression <span lang="ja">＿ざるを得ない</span> meaning "unable
                    to not _".
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span lang="ja">べき</span> was originally the predicative form of <span lang="ja">べし</span>. Its
                    negative form is <span lang="ja">べからず</span>. Also, in old Japanese
                    <span lang="ja">べし</span> meant a lot more than just "should/ought". Specifically, it indicates
                    likelihood/volition/intent/obvious truth/recommendation/order/possibility. Again, when a modern
                    speaker uses this it's usually very obvious which of these are intended, so don't let it scare you.
                </li>

                <li>
                    The <a href="OJ.html#why">ancient</a> -a yu form (later replaced by -a ru and -i raru) is both a
                    potential and a passive form. It's probably the origin of the modern words
                    <span lang="ja">いわゆる</span> (passive of "to say" → said to be → the so-called) and
                    <span lang="ja">あらゆる</span> (able to exist → all _s which can exit → various/many/all kinds).
                </li>

                <li>
                    The phrase <span lang="ja">言わんばかり</span> is the -a mu/n form (in this case, it's like a
                    volitional form) plus the old <span lang="ja">ばかり</span> (which means
                    <span lang="ja">ほど</span> or <span lang="ja">ぐらい</span>). It's almost always correct to
                    translate it as "as if to say".
                </li>

                <li>
                    The -i <span lang="ja">つつ</span> form means "continue _ing", "repeatedly _" or "_ alongside/while
                    _ing".
                </li>

                <li>
                    The old version of <span lang="ja">ば</span>, both as a particle and as part of the -eba form, means
                    "since/because" (like <span lang="ja">から</span>). Nowadays it means "if".
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span lang="ja">ごとく</span> means what <span lang="ja">らしい</span> and
                    <span lang="ja">みたい</span> do nowadays. However, like -i tsutsu, there are still some authors who
                    use <span lang="ja">ごとく</span> a lot. You may also see its attributive form
                    <span lang="ja">ごとき</span>.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span lang="ja">にて</span> can mark place/time (like <span lang="ja">に</span>), means/method (like
                    <span lang="ja">で</span>), someone's situation/status (like <span lang="ja">として</span>), or a
                    cause/reason (like <span lang="ja">から</span>). Don't let the multiple meanings scare you, it's
                    usually very obvious which is intended.
                </li>

                <li><span lang="ja">なり</span> and <span lang="ja">たり</span> are just old gobi.</li>

                <li><span lang="ja">のみ</span> is pretty much identical to <span lang="ja">だけ</span>.</li>

                <li>
                    <span lang="ja">だに</span> means "if nothing else", "at the very least", "not even _ much less _".

                    As you may have noticed, modern Japanese has some confusing/redundant verbs such as
                    <span lang="ja">言わす</span> and <span lang="ja">合わす</span> which seem to be just causative
                    versions of <span lang="ja">言う</span> and <span lang="ja">合う</span>. The old causative form was
                    in fact -asu instead of -aseru, so this redundancy is just the result of those verbs being so common
                    their old causative forms had a lot of inertia.

                Unfortunately, I am not very knowledgeable about dialects. But I can list several things distinctive of
                Kansai-ben which, I feel, is enough to make the vast majority of lines in that dialect comprehensible.
                I'll expand this if I ever I get the chance to study dialects properly.

                That should be enough to make sense out of any random Kansai you come across. There are of course dozens
                of other minor differences, but the ones listed above are among the most likely to throw you off or
                genuinely confuse you since they involve forms/particles/words you would never see otherwise.

                The thickest, frequently-occuring Kansai dialect I've personally encountered in manga/anime/etc is that
                of Sket Dance's main heroine Himeko, so I would read some of that if for some reason you really want to
                learn basic Kansai.
