                            Shimotsuki Mirei. That scene is also seen by Minagi Shiori, a model student who is also in
                            Kaoru‚Äôs class. In state of despondence, Kaoru opens up to Shiori about her past with Mirei.
                            After listening intently to Kaoru‚Äôs story, Shiori, with a mysterious air about her, poses a
                            question.

                            Grammar and vocabulary are nothing special. The most distinctive characteristic is the
                            longer sentences which seem to be a staple of the author's style. I'd imagine it can be
                            difficult if you're not that comfortable those kinds of sentences, but a lot of them are
                            voiced and aren't actually too complex. There are a handful of forced auto-read sections,
                            around 4 if I'm remembering correctly, that were just way too fast but they're not too
                            lengthy.

                            While its predecessor used a lot of obscure kanji and weird katakana words, this one seems
                            to have more "standard" terminology. However the language is much more descriptive and
                            elaborate and there's a lot more narrative passages and sequences compared to the first one.
                            I'd say the level of the language is slightly harder than the previous one and people who
                            played the first one but aren't good with visual novel language might struggle a bit more

                            One could argue Hard would be better since the VN is actually quite short, but it is harder
                            than anything above. Novel-like writing, complicated <span lang="ja">Êº¢Ë™û</span> to the
                            point of using actual Chinese words, infodumps about Kung Fu and technology, immense
                            vocabulary... Very rough. That being said the writing is great, it's just that you won't
                            have seen these words from reading other visual novels alone.

                            In this age where technology is changing the face of combat, heirs to the ancient martial
                            traditions have developed anti-cyborg techniques for the sole purpose of defeating cyborgs
                            with one's bare hands. Kong Taoluo, one such master and former asssassin in the Qingyun
                            Society, returns to Shanghai after being betrayed by the syndicate and assumed dead.
                            Discovering what has happened to his sister during his absence; Taoluo swears an oath of
                            vengeance and sets out to murder those responsible.
