                            Kaoruko "Chaos" Moeta is a young manga artist who is down on her luck. She wants to draw
                            manga about high school girls, but her storyboards are bland, her art uninspired, and her
                            premises weak. Her concerned, exasperated editor comes up with an idea: push Chaos to be
                            more social. So, by her recommendation, Chaos moves into a dormitory for female manga
                            artists.

                            It's easy because all of the dialogues are simple, most of the words are very common, and
                            the grammar is very basic. It's not very easy because sometimes the dialogue between the

                            it for beginners, but the speed of the dialogue is certainly higher than, say, Takagi San.

                            The anime is full of phraseology, long dialogues that use words or vocabulary that are not
                            commonly used. In addition, everything is pronounced quite quickly and if you do not hear
                            it, you can miss the whole essence of the dialog or monologue.
