                            Farland Story is the first in the row of successful Japanese strategy RPG games. The main

                            One day, when Arc and his best friend Randia are out of town, a hostile army under the
                            command of a mysterious Black Knight invades the town and kidnaps Ferio. Thus begins Arc's

                            particularly hard and it's not very text heavy. For most of the game you just have to go
                            through various stages and fight enemies, and there are clear quest markers on the stage
                            selection telling you where to go even if you can't follow the story. The dialogues
                            sometimes throw at you some tricky words, but overall it's pretty average for a JRPG.
