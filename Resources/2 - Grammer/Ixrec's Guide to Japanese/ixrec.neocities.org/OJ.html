<p><u><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Old Japanese</span></u></p>

<p>This page is extremely incomplete and <b>unreliable</b> because I'm not yet capable of reading old Japanese. In fact, this is mostly here for my own sake. Putting together what I know into some guide-like form helps me retain and organize the knowledge better. But since it's not total crap, and you guys might learn something from this, I might as well upload it.
<br>
<br>Pretty much all the information here comes directly from the books I've been using to study old Japanese, along with some "supplementary research" (browsing Japanese wikipedia articles) to fill in the details. One of the books is a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E6%97%BA%E6%96%87%E7%A4%BE%E5%8F%A4%E8%AA%9E%E8%BE%9E%E5%85%B8-%E6%9D%BE%E6%9D%91-%E6%98%8E/dp/4010721197">ridiculously informative dictionary</a> for old Japanese, complete with grammar guide, and the other is an edition of the Tale of Genji which includes the original text, a modern translation and lots of translation notes. Just to be clear, neither book contains any English, which is part of the reason me translating and repackaging the information here might be of some use to someone.
<br>
<br>This page is written on the assumption that you have little to no difficulty reading modern Japanese, or "Kinseigo", since I'll be defining things in terms of modern Japanese whenever it's convenient.

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><u>Introductory Stuff</u></span></p>

<p> </p>

<a name="why"></a>
<p><u>Why <span lang="ja">中古語</span> Chuukogo?</u></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The history of the Japanese language has four stages:
<br><span lang="ja">上代（じょうだい）日本語</span> - Old Japanese,
<br><span lang="ja">中古（ちゅうこ）日本語</span> - Early Middle Japanese,
<br><span lang="ja">中世（ちゅうせい）日本語</span> - Late Middle Japanese,
<br>and of course <span lang="ja">近世（きんせい）日本語</span> - Modern Japanese.
<br>To avoid any risk of ambiguity, I'll be referring to these as Joudaigo, Chuukogo, Chuuseigo and Kinseigo throughout this page. I'll use the adjectives "ancient" to imply Joudaigo, "old" to imply Chuukogo and "modern" to imply Kinseigo. Also, anything on this page marked with an asterisk (*) is unique to Joudaigo.
<br>Also, up until recently, Japanese had a literary form called <span lang="ja">文語（ぶんご）</span> which was separate from the spoken form, or <span lang="ja">口語（こうご）</span>.<br>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This page is primarily about Chuukogo, for various reasons. First, <span lang="ja">文語</span> is extremely similar to Chuukogo, so many modern-day Japanese speakers still have some familiarity with features of Chuukogo, which causes them to pop up in otherwise modern Japanese every so often.<br>
Second, Japanese literature took off in the Heian period, when Chuukogo was being used, so most classics of Japanese fiction are written in Chuukogo (like the Tale of Genji) or Chuuseigo (like the Tale of Heike), which is much closer to Chuukogo than the others. For comparison, the most famous works written in Joudaigo are the Kojiki (mythology), Nihon Shoki (history) and Man'youshuu (poetry).<br>
Third, to oversimplify things a bit, Joudaigo relied on a system of phonetic kanji called man'yougana, which was later used to develop the kana we're familiar with (in fact, man'yougana means "the kana used by the man'youshuu"). So even if you're more interested in Joudaigo, it seems like it might be better to learn Chuukogo (or maybe Chinese?) first and then transition to Joudaigo.

<a name="changes"></a>
<p><u>What Has and Hasn't Changed</u></p>

<p> </p>

<p>For obvious reasons, most of the sections below will be listing facts unique to Chuukogo. So before all that, I'll give a very rough semi-accurate summary here of what aspects of Japanese seem to have changed between Chuukogo and Kinseigo, and which haven't.
<br>
<br>Chuukogo uses the same kana and kanji, but adds two kana (<span lang="ja">ゐ</span> wi and <span lang="ja">ゑ</span> we) and introduces several additional cases of alternate kana pronunciations (in Modern Japanese the only case is <span lang="ja">は</span> being read wa).
<br>
<br>The major meanings of the basic particles are the same in both. <span lang="ja">は</span> and <span lang="ja">が</span> still mark subjects, <span lang="ja">を</span> still marks objects, <span lang="ja">で</span> still marks means/method, <span lang="ja">と</span> still marks quotes, <span lang="ja">か</span> still marks questions (though now <span lang="ja">や</span> does too), the annoying mess of meanings <span lang="ja">に</span> has is basically the same, etc. In fact, all the particle meanings I would consider difficult are unchanged, so adapting to Chuukogo's particles is relatively easy.
<br>Several particles have additional meanings in Chuukogo. For instance, <span lang="ja">は</span> and <span lang="ja">を</span> are now also sentence enders, <span lang="ja">の</span> can also mark subjects.
<br>There are a few particles which fell out of use after Chuukogo, like <span lang="ja">にて</span> and <span lang="ja">やは</span>, but these are outnumbered by more familiar particles.
<br>A lot of the grammatical words in Chuukogo will look familiar, and many will also have similar meanings. A handful will be brand new though (including ones like <span lang="ja">なる</span> which don't look new at all).
<br>
<br>With Chuukogo's particles, grammatical words and verb forms, there is a much stronger tendency for a given meaning to be expressable in several different ways (there are about <i>eleven</i> ways to mark the cause or reason for an event), and for a single particle/word/form to have several different meanings at once (as you can see below, <span lang="ja">べし</span> has seven meanings). To say it more pessimistically: there's a lot more needless overlap, and a lot more frustrating ambiguity.
<br>
<br>A very large chunk of the vocabulary is the same, once you get used to alternate spellings caused by the alternate pronunciations and different conjugation system (e.g. <span lang="ja">かひなし</span> is the same as <span lang="ja">甲斐ない</span>).
<br>Of course, there's also a lot of vocabulary that changed significantly. In my experience, the familiar meanings of these words simply don't make sense in context, which should be enough of a clue to look them up.
<br>Somehow, there seem to be almost no words that have sort of the same meaning but just changed in some subtle way to confuse you (many did change subtly, but so far not in ways that misled me at all).
<br>
<br>The way clauses work is, as far as I can tell, essentially the same. The problem is that Chuukogo seems more fond of leaving lots of subjects and objects implicit (apparently referring to people by name was rude in the imperial court, so for all I know this issue might be unique to the Tale of Genji). Also, many of its particles, verb forms and transition words often act as if there's an implicit <span lang="ja">事</span> or <span lang="ja">状態</span> or <span lang="ja">ように</span> or some other noun or phrase following them. Thus, it's much harder to "guess" how the clauses fit together even though the basic rules are the same. The most common implicit nouns/phrases for a given particle/form/word will be mentioned as part of its definition in the lists below.
<br>
<br>The syntactic nature of verb forms is very similar. By that I mean that conjugating still consists of changing the last letter of a verb, attaching a suffix, and possibly repeating with the last letter of that suffix.
<br>However, the majority of the verb forms you're familiar with don't exist in Chuukogo, and most of the verb forms in Chuukogo don't exist in Kinseigo.
<br>One exception is the -i form. Also, compound verbs were just as common back then as they are now.
<br>A partial exception is the -eba form. I say partial because it's no longer a conditional form. Instead of "if _ then _", it now means "because" or "therefore". It's extremely common, so get used to this fast.
<br>As mentioned on the Conjugation page, the jodoushi model of verb conjugation (the one the Japanese themselves use) is much better for explaining Chuukogo than the gaijin model you're used to, so I'll be introducing it below.
<br>Chuukogo adjectives end in <span lang="ja">し</span> in their default form, not <span lang="ja">い</span>.
<br>
<br>Also, Chuukogo verb forms tend to be noticably shorter on average, which is a major cause of the aforementioned overlap. For instance, the -a nu (negative) and -i nu forms (past tense, sorta) are spelled identically on <span lang="ja">一段</span> and <span lang="ja">二段</span> verbs. It gets worse when these forms are themselves conjugated: an -i te form might be a conjunctive -te, or it could be a form of the -i tsu form (another past tense, sorta). Surprisingly, it's not that hard to deal with this, but doing so often requires looking at what comes before and after each part of the conjugated verb, which is probably not how you're used to identifying forms. For instance, a conjunctive -i te would have no further inflections, whereas the -i tsu form changed to -i te must be followed by something (and yes, it's possible to derive most of that claim directly from the information I give below).

<p>Here I'm just going to try listing a bunch of words that either pop up so often you'll just need to know them, or are noteworthy for their contrast with parts of the modern lexicon. This part is very much a mess right now. In particular, I know almost nothing about the pronouns right now.</p>

<tr><td></td> <td></td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>There are also some words which miraculously manage to have almost exactly the same set of meanings in both old and new Japanese. <span lang="ja">色</span> is one example. I might try listing some of these later.</p>

<p> </p>

<a name="kana"></a>
<p><u>Changes to the Kana</u></p>

<p> </p>

<p>First, the easy one: The <span lang="ja">ゐ</span> wi and <span lang="ja">ゑ</span> we hiragana actually get used, so remember them.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Now, remember how each kana has exactly one pronunciation, with the exception of <span lang="ja">は</span> being read wa when it's a particle? Chuukogo has a lot more exceptions.
<br>Fortunately, most of the exceptions are reasonably intuitive: <span lang="ja">はひふへほをづぢゐゑ</span> may be read as <span lang="ja">わいうえおおずじいえ</span> respectively. I'm pretty sure there are a few others, but that covers the vast majority. As a quick example, the old way of writing <span lang="ja">思います</span> is <span lang="ja">思ひたまふ</span>, which would be read <span lang="ja">思いたまう</span>. Thankfully, conjugation doesn't add any complications to this. For instance, <span lang="ja">たまふ（たまう）</span> has forms like <span lang="ja">たまはず（たまわず）</span> and <span lang="ja">たまへば（たまえば）</span>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Finally, this isn't really a change to the kana, but it'll probably save you some headaches if I tell you about this now. There are a few kana, like <span lang="ja">で</span> and <span lang="ja">だ</span>, which you're used to seeing only as particles or in verb stems. But in Chuukogo, there are dzu-type verbs like <span lang="ja">出づ（いづ）</span> and <span lang="ja">まかづ</span> which can conjugate to things like <span lang="ja">出だぬ</span> or <span lang="ja">まかでたまふ</span>.</p>

<p> </p>

<a name="common"></a>
<p><u>Common Particle Meanings</u></p>

<p> </p>

<p>To deal with overlap efficiently, I'm going to use some Japanese terms for particularly common meanings.
<br>1) <span lang="ja">感動語尾</span> - a sentence ending particle used when the speaker is emotionally moved by the action (by the way, I made this one up, it's not a real Japanese term).
<br>2) <span lang="ja">逆説</span> - the word for "contradictory conjunction". In English these include "but", "however", "despite", "although", etc.
<br>3) <span lang="ja">原因助詞</span> - the words for "cause/reason" and "particle". Basically, any particle which (like the modern <span lang="ja">から</span>) may mark the cause or reason for an action later in the sentence (I also made this one up).
</p>

<p> </p>

<a name="casegobi"></a>
<p><u>Case Markers and <span lang="ja">語尾</span> Gobi</u></p>

<ul>
<li><span lang="ja">は</span> is basically the same, though may be used to add emphasis, or as a <span lang="ja">語尾</span> (without <span lang="ja">感動</span>).</li>
<li><span lang="ja">も</span> is basically the same, though it's also a <span lang="ja">感動語尾</span>.</li>
<li><span lang="ja">を</span> still marks objects, though sometimes it's a bit closer to <span lang="ja">と</span> or <span lang="ja">から</span> than you might be used to. It's also a <span lang="ja">感動語尾</span>.</li>
<li><span lang="ja">に</span> has all the same meanings as before, plus it's now a <span lang="ja">原因助詞</span>. When used at the end of a clause, it can be a <span lang="ja">逆説</span>.</li>
<li><span lang="ja">へ</span> is basically the same</li>
<li><span lang="ja">と</span> is basically the same, though it can also be used to list phrases for a comparison (<span lang="ja">＿と＿と</span>...)</li>
<li><span lang="ja">な</span> has nothing to do with adjectives anymore, but its negative command meaning still exists, and it's also a <span lang="ja">感動語尾</span>.</li>
<br>
<li><span lang="ja">の</span> and <span lang="ja">が</span> have all the same meanings they do in Kinseigo. But they also have each other's meanings (this was a big WTF moment for me). For instance, <span lang="ja">が</span> can denote possession, and <span lang="ja">の</span> can mark subjects. There are also some cases where it's easier to interpret an old <span lang="ja">の</span> or <span lang="ja">が</span> by assuming an implicit <span lang="ja">ように</span>, <span lang="ja">もの</span> or <span lang="ja">こと</span> comes next.</li>
<li><span lang="ja">から</span> and <span lang="ja">より</span> also have all the same meanings plus each others'. Of course, they're pretty close in Kinseigo already, so this isn't too bad. They also have a new meaning of "through".</li>
<br>
<li><span lang="ja">や</span> and <span lang="ja">やは</span> mark questions. In addition, the question may be a rhetorical one with an implicit negative answer (<span lang="ja">＿か</span>？<span lang="ja">いや、ないだろう）</span>. <span lang="ja">や</span> can also act either like <span lang="ja">よ</span>/<span lang="ja">な</span>, or like <span lang="ja">やら</span>/<span lang="ja">など</span>. I don't know how to differentiate between these uses yet.</li>
<li><span lang="ja">か</span> can mark questions or be a <span lang="ja">感動語尾</span>. <span lang="ja">かな</span> is strictly a <span lang="ja">感動語尾</span>. <span lang="ja">かは</span> strictly marks questions, possibly rhetorical ones with negative answers.</li>
<li><span lang="ja">よ</span> is basically the same as its modern usage.</li>
<li><span lang="ja">ぞ</span> is still a <span lang="ja">語尾</span>, though it can also be used to provide emphasis earlier in the sentence.</li>
<li><span lang="ja">なり</span> and <span lang="ja">たり</span> are ordinary <span lang="ja">語尾</span> if the verb is conjugated, otherwise <span lang="ja">なり</span> has a different meaning (see next section).</li>
<br>
<li><span lang="ja">にて</span> can mark place/time (like <span lang="ja">に</span>/"at"/"on"), means/method (like <span lang="ja">で</span>), someone's situation/status (like <span lang="ja">として</span>), or cause/reason (so it's a <span lang="ja">原因助詞</span>).</li>
<li>After a noun or clause, <span lang="ja">して</span> marks means/method (like <span lang="ja">で</span>), or a person or group of people who perform an action or are used to perform an action (sometimes overlaps with <span lang="ja">で</span>).</li>
<li>After an adjective or a verb in its -i form, <span lang="ja">して</span> is a <span lang="ja">逆説</span>, a <span lang="ja">原因助詞</span>, can mean "and", or mark a state/situation.</li>
<br>
<li>*<span lang="ja">ゆ</span> and *<span lang="ja">よ</span> can mean "through", "more than", <span lang="ja">から</span>, or mark a beginning (in space or time). *<span lang="ja">ゆり</span> is similar.</li>

<p>Don't worry about the little "conjugation" parts for now. They'll be explained a few sections later. Last but not least, here are the tricky ones.</p>

<ul>
<li><span lang="ja">らむ</span>/<span lang="ja">らん</span> denotes present actions the speaker knows about secondhand, or is guessing are happening. This may also mark the cause of the action in the next clause. If the speaker does know about it firsthand, this asks why it's happening. Compare to -i <span lang="ja">けむ</span>/<span lang="ja">けん</span> below.
<li><span lang="ja">らし</span> indicates an inferred cause of or reason for some event the speaker perceives directly.
<span style='font-size:8.0pt'><table class='SFC'><tr><td>Conjugation:</td> <td><span lang="ja">＿</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">＿</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">らし</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">らし</span><br><span lang="ja">らしき</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">らし</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">＿</span></td></tr></table></span>
<li><span lang="ja">なり</span> indicates an event inferred from noises or voices the speaker heard, or something they know through hearsay.
<span style='font-size:8.0pt'><table class='SFC'><tr><td>Conjugation:</td> <td><span lang="ja">＿</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">なり</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">なり</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">なる</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">なれ</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">＿</span></td></tr></table></span>
<li><span lang="ja">べし</span> indicates likelihood/volition/intent/obvious truth/recommendation/order/possibility. Seriously, it can be any of those.
<span style='font-size:8.0pt'><table class='SFC'><tr><td>Conjugation:</td> <td><span lang="ja">べから</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">べく</span><br><span lang="ja">べかり</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">べし</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">べき</span><br><span lang="ja">べかる</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">べけれ</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">＿</span></td></tr></table></span>
<li><span lang="ja">まじ</span> is the negative of <span lang="ja">べし</span>, so it indicates unlikelihood/non-volition/non-intent/obvious falsehood/prohibition/negative order/impossibility.
<span style='font-size:8.0pt'><table class='SFC'><tr><td>Conjugation:</td> <td><span lang="ja">まじから</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">まじく</span><br><span lang="ja">まじかり</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">まじ</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">まじき</span><br><span lang="ja">まじかる</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">まじけれ</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">＿</span></td></tr></table></span>
<li><span lang="ja">り</span> denotes actions that are complete, but whose effects persist (like 〜<span lang="ja">て</span>・<span lang="ja">ある</span>). Since there are weird restrictions on when this form can and can't be used, the -i <span lang="ja">たり</span> form (same meaning) is much more popular.
<span style='font-size:8.0pt'><table class='SFC'><tr><td>Conjugation:</td> <td><span lang="ja">ら</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">り</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">り</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">る</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">れ</span></td> <td><span lang="ja">れ</span></td></tr></table></span>
</ul>

<p><span lang="ja">べし</span> should look very familiar because its predicative form <span lang="ja">べき</span> and to a lesser extent its negative form <span lang="ja">べからず</span> (and <span lang="ja">べし</span> itself) are still present in Kinseigo. Obviously, it has dropped a lot of those meanings over the past several centuries. I also suspect the modern <span lang="ja">まい</span> form has a lot to do with <span lang="ja">まじ</span>.
<br>
<br>I don't know for sure how you're supposed to tell the difference between all the meanings of <span lang="ja">べし</span> and <span lang="ja">まじ</span>, but I suspect it's very similar to what you do with the -a mu form described below.

<p><u>Verb Categories</u></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Before, I defined "verb type" as the letter a verb ends in by default, which determines how its other forms are spelled. A "verb category" is a set of rules determining these spellings based on type. In Kinseigo, <span lang="ja">一段</span> ichidan and <span lang="ja">五段</span> godan are the only verb categories, and all <span lang="ja">一段</span> ichidan verbs are -ru type anyway, so categories just weren't that important before.
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In old Japanese, we have the categories <span lang="ja">一段</span> ichidan, <span lang="ja">二段</span> nidan and <span lang="ja">四段</span> yondan (as far as I can tell <span lang="ja">三段</span> sandan doesn't exist). Technically, <span lang="ja">一段</span> and <span lang="ja">二段</span> are each split into "upper" and "lower" categories depending on whether the stem's last vowel is i or e respectively. This doesn't actually affect how the verbs conjugate, so I will ignore it and write lots of "i/e"s instead.
<br>There are also small categories for irregular verbs. <span lang="ja">カ変</span> is short for <span lang="ja">カ行変格活用</span> "k-sound irregular conjugation", meaning any irregular verb starting with <span lang="ja">か</span>, <span lang="ja">け</span>, <span lang="ja">き</span>, <span lang="ja">こ</span> or <span lang="ja">く</span> (though the only verb actually in this category is <span lang="ja">く</span>). Likewise, there are <span lang="ja">サ変</span>, <span lang="ja">ナ変</span> amd <span lang="ja">ラ変</span> categories. Kinseigo has these categories too, but so few verbs are in them that it's usually not worth mentioning.
<br>Also, adjectives are split into ku-type and shiku-type. In Kinseigo, it's often said there are i-adjectives and na-adjectives, but the vast majority of na-adjectives are really just nouns with a particle after them, so they kinda don't count. In Chuukogo, nari-type and tari-type adjectives are the same way, so I will be ignoring these.

<p><u>The Jodoushi Model</u></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Now, as promised, I'll tell you the model that the Japanese use to explain Japanese verb conjugation. Long story short: everything that can be conjugated has exactly six basic forms. Depending on the verb/adjective/whatever, some of these forms may have no spellings (i.e. they can't be used at all) or multiple spellings (which are interchangeable), but usually it's one spelling each.
<br>
<br>The six forms are:
<table BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=3 style='font-size:11.0pt'><col width="180"><col width="130">
<tr><td>Japanese Name</td> <td>English Name</td> <td>Usage</td></tr>
<tr><td><span lang="ja">未然形（みぜんけい）</span></td> <td>Incomplete Form</td> <td>Like the -te and -i forms, this is used to make several complex forms</td></tr>
<tr><td><span lang="ja">連用形（れんようけい）</span></td> <td>Connective Form</td> <td>The modern <span lang="ja">連用形</span> is called the -i form in the gaijin model.<br>The old <span lang="ja">連用形</span> has the same uses, including forming compound verbs.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span lang="ja">終止形（しゅうしけい）</span></td> <td>Predicative Form</td> <td>For verbs meant to end a sentence, i.e. verbs in the "main predicate". This also serves as the default/dictionary/infinitive form.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span lang="ja">連体形（れんたいけい）</span></td> <td>Attributive Form</td> <td>For verbs at the end of a clause meant to describe a noun, i.e. "attribute" an action to it.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span lang="ja">已然形（いぜんけい）</span></td> <td>Conjunctive Form</td> <td>Used by certain particles to express meanings like "since" and "however" (which are conjunctions in English).</td></tr>
<tr><td><span lang="ja">命令形（めいれいけい）</span></td> <td>Command Form</td> <td>Exactly what it sounds like.</td></tr>
</table>
<br>The Connective and Command Forms should be extremely familiar. The Incomplete Form is a bit odd, but similar enough to things you're familiar with that it shouldn't take long to get used to. The Conjunctive Form may look very odd now, but once you look at the itty-bitty table for it below, you should grasp it very quickly. Just so you know, the jodoushi model for Kinseigo refers to the <span lang="ja">已然形</span> as the <span lang="ja">仮定形</span> or "Hypothetical Form".
<br>The introduction of the Attributive Form is probably the weirdest part, largely because in modern Japanese the Predicative and Attributive Forms are completely identical. For instance, the old verbs <span lang="ja">す</span> and <span lang="ja">く</span> had Attributive Forms <span lang="ja">する</span> and <span lang="ja">くる</span>, and nowadays we refer to those verbs as <span lang="ja">する</span> and <span lang="ja">くる</span> since their Predicative Forms have been phased out.
<br>
<br>Because of this strong "only six forms" premise, we can give a concise and complete description of verb/adjective/whatever's conjugation by simply listing those six forms in the correct order. For instance, the six forms of <span lang="ja">す</span> are <span lang="ja">せ</span> (incomplete), <span lang="ja">し</span> (connective), <span lang="ja">す</span> (predicative), <span lang="ja">する</span> (attributive), <span lang="ja">すれ</span> (conjunctive), and <span lang="ja">せよ</span> (command). In my Chuukogo dictionary, and many other books about Japanese written in Japanese, it's common to to list these in an extremely concise form such as: <span lang="ja">（せ</span>・<span lang="ja">し</span>・<span lang="ja">す</span>・<span lang="ja">する</span>・<span lang="ja">すれ</span>・<span lang="ja">せよ）</span>. In fact, I already put similar lists underneath some of the "grammatical words" listed above.
<br>
<br>Now, why am I calling this the "jodoushi" model? Because most of the things you're used to calling "forms" are the result of attaching either a <span lang="ja">助動詞</span> jodoushi or a particle to one of the six basic forms. A jodoushi is any non-lexical word (i.e. "particle" in the broadest sense) that can itself conjugate to the six forms. Thus all of the "grammatical words" above that I attached a list of conjugations to are actually jodoushi. For the rest of this page, "particle" specifically means non-lexical words that don't conjugate (though hopefully that was already part of your intuitive definition).
<br>
<br>For instance, in Kinseigo, what we've been calling the "negative form" is actually the result of attaching <span lang="ja">ない</span> (a jodoushi) to the Incomplete Form (<span lang="ja">走らない</span> = <span lang="ja">走ら</span> + <span lang="ja">ない</span>), and what we've been calling the "hypothetical form" is actually the result of attaching <span lang="ja">ば</span> (a particle) to the Hypothetical Form (<span lang="ja">行けば</span> = <span lang="ja">行け</span> + <span lang="ja">ば</span>). As a direct result, the grammar guide that came with my Chuukogo dictionary was essentially just a list of particles and jodoushi.
<br>
<br>Okay, we're finally done with the conceptual foundation, so we can move on to some real conjugation. Since there's only six forms now (and I'm no longer treating verb types separately since I'm sure you can deal with that by now), there's no reason not to just throw up a complete conjugation table.

<p><br>This particular table is a heavily altered version of one I stole from <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%8F%A4%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E#.E5.8B.95.E8.A9.9E.E3.81.AE.E6.B4.BB.E7.94.A8">wikipedia</a>. I bring that up only because, if you want to learn more about the jodoushi model itself, separately from Chuukogo, that link is a good starting point.</p>

<p> </p>

<a name="forms"></a>
<p><u>List of Chuukogo Verb Forms</u></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Within the jodoushi model, I use "verb form" to refer to certain combinations of one of the six basic forms with either a particle or a jodoushi. Specifically, I mean those combinations where the particle/jodoushi must be attached to a verb (not a noun) conjugated to a specific <i>non-infinitive</i> form (so <span lang="ja">べし</span>, <span lang="ja">まじ</span>, etc don't count). That may sound a little confusing and arbitrary, but this matches the intuitive distinction between "grammatical words" and "verb forms" that I've used in the main guide, so it's worth using here too.
<br>Only three of the non-infinitive verb forms actually apply here. The <span lang="ja">終止形</span> doesn't count because it's the infinitive form, and I ruled that out. The <span lang="ja">命令形</span> doesn't count because nothing attaches specifically to it (of course some particles can come after it, like <span lang="ja">と</span>, but those can come after anything). The <span lang="ja">連体形</span> doesn't count because every particle that attaches to it also attaches to nouns (in fact, when you see a "clause-ending particle" in old Japanese, it's often a good idea to assume an implied noun).
<br>So, using my (purportedly intuitive) definition of "verb form", all complex forms are based on <span lang="ja">已然形</span>, <span lang="ja">未然形</span> and <span lang="ja">連用形</span>. This should be very comforting, since the <span lang="ja">未然形</span> and <span lang="ja">連用形</span> are analogous to the -te and -i forms you're used to, and the <span lang="ja">已然形</span> only makes two extremely specific and easy to remember forms. Let's get <span lang="ja">已然形</span> out of the way first.

<p>Obviously, it would be stupid for me to try and write my own sentences, so I'll be taking a handful of lines I like from Genji or the example sentences in my dictionary. By "expert translation", I mean a translation provided by the book I found the sentence in.
<br>The biggest reason I chose these sentences is that I'm pretty sure I actually understand how all the parts add up to the translation provided. Admittedly, a few things about them still puzzle me, and are thus ignored in my explanations, but considering I've only studied Chuukogo for one or two months total, that's unavoidable.

<p>Old Japanese: <span lang="ja">かなはざりける命のほどぞ尽きせずうらめしき。</span>
<br>Step-by-step Parsing: The first word is the verb <span lang="ja">かなふ</span>, which in this case is the same as <span lang="ja">叶う（かなう）</span>. It's conjugated to the -a <span lang="ja">ざる</span> negative form, then the <span lang="ja">ざる</span> conjugated to its past tense -i <span lang="ja">けり</span> form, and finally that <span lang="ja">けり</span> to its predicative form <span lang="ja">ける</span> because it's being used to describe the noun phrase <span lang="ja">命のほど</span>. Thus, <span lang="ja">かなはざりける</span> is equivalent to <span lang="ja">叶わなかった</span>.
<br>For <span lang="ja">命のほど</span>, we have to remember that <span lang="ja">ほど</span> can mean <span lang="ja">時間</span>. Essentially, this phrase is meant to refer to the length of a life. The particle <span lang="ja">ぞ</span> at the end is just emphasis (though it should sound very weird). Next, <span lang="ja">尽き</span> and <span lang="ja">せず</span> are more or less the same as modern Japanese: "exhaust" and "to not". In this case, their combination means something like <span lang="ja">限りなく</span>. Finally, <span lang="ja">うらめし</span> is the same as <span lang="ja">恨めしい</span> "reproachful", except it's in its predicative -ki form, because the phrase <span lang="ja">尽きせずうらめしき</span> is meant to be describing <span lang="ja">命のほど</span>. Notice that the presence of <span lang="ja">ぞ</span> allows the <span lang="ja">尽きせずうらめしき</span> phrase to describe something retroactively without causing confusion.
<br>Putting all that together, we have something like "the length of a life, which is such that (some wish) could not be granted, is infinitely reproachful." In the context of the story, the speaker is bemoaning the fact that his lover's life was too short for her to fulfill a promise they'd made.
<br>Expert Translation to Modern Japanese: (<span lang="ja">その願いの</span>)<span lang="ja">かなえられなかった命のはかなさが限りもなく恨めしいのである。</span>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Old Japanese: <span lang="ja">秋ならで妻よぶ鹿を聞きしがなをりから声の身にはしむかと</span>
<br>Step-by-step Parsing: First, the -a <span lang="ja">で</span> form of <span lang="ja">なる</span> is a negation. Second, the -i <span lang="ja">しがな</span> form is kinda like -i tai, but with a "were it possible, I would love to _" nuance. From that, you can see how the first part of this sentence means "I would love to hear a deer call for his mate when it was not autumn."
<br>Recall <span lang="ja">をり</span> means "time". The <span lang="ja">から</span> here marks a cause rather than a start. Notice the <span lang="ja">の</span> particle is marking <span lang="ja">声</span> as a subject. The verb <span lang="ja">しむ</span> is basically <span lang="ja">沈む</span>. The <span lang="ja">かと</span> is the same as modern Japanese. So the second part means "I suspect that voice sinks into my body because of the time", where "time" refers to the season of autumn and "sinks into my body" means exactly what you'd expect.
<br>Expert Translation to Modern Japanese: <span lang="ja">秋以外の時に、妻を呼んで鳴く鹿の声を聞きたいものだな。秋という季節だからこのように声が身にしみるかと。</span>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Old Japanese: <span lang="ja">右近の司の宿直奏の声聞こゆるは、丑になりぬるなるべし。</span>
<br>Step-by-step Parsing: The first part of this sentence just requires you to know things, so focus on the more interesting second part once you read this. <span lang="ja">右近の司</span> refers to a particular guard whose shift is at <span lang="ja">丑</span> (1-3 AM). <span lang="ja">宿直奏</span> refers to a guard announcing their name when their shift begins. <span lang="ja">声聞こゆる</span> is exactly what it looks like: "hearing the voice of (the guard saying his own name)".
<br>Now the fun part. The first <span lang="ja">なる</span> is the usual verb "to become", conjugated to -i nu form, the nu's predicative form adds a ru, to which the naru particle attaches (inferring event based on something heard, in this case the guard's voice), to which the beshi particle attaches (the subject is third person so interpret it as likelihood). Thus this adds up to "It's probably (based on what he heard) just about 1 AM."
<br>Expert Translation to Modern Japanese: <span lang="ja">右近衛府の宿直奏の声が聞こえてくるのは、もう丑の時になってしまっているのであろう。</span>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Old Japanese: <span lang="ja">さるまじき御（おほむ）ふるまひもうちまじりける。</span>
<br>Step-by-step Parsing: <span lang="ja">さる</span> is like <span lang="ja">ある</span>, <span lang="ja">まじき</span> is the attribute form of <span lang="ja">まじ</span>. Together these mean something like "_ which should not be" which can be interpreted as "undesireable" or "inappropriate".
<br><span lang="ja">御</span> and <span lang="ja">ふるまひ</span> are the same as <span lang="ja">おふるまい</span> despite the weird spelling. <span lang="ja">も</span> is a particle by itself. <span lang="ja">うちまじる</span> is <span lang="ja">まじりあう</span> and -i <span lang="ja">ける</span> is past tense. So the whole line is "Inappropriate behavior was mixed in", which, based on the context I haven't transcribed, means "Sometimes he acted inappropriately."
<br>The <span lang="ja">とか</span> in the expert translation probably reflects the fact that <span lang="ja">ける</span> is for secondhand knowledge.
<br>Expert Translation to Modern Japanese: <span lang="ja">時には不都合なおふるまいもなくはないのだったとか。</span>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Old Japanese: <span lang="ja">おのづからかしこまりもえおかず、心の中（うち）に思ふことを隠しあへずなむ、むつれきこえたまひける。</span>
<br>Step-by-step Parsing: <span lang="ja">おのづから</span> is like "by onself" in modern JP, here it's like <span lang="ja">自然と</span> "naturally". <span lang="ja">かしこまる</span> here means something like "to be respectfully quiet". There's an <span lang="ja">え＿</span>[negative], meaning "unable to _", around an <span lang="ja">おく</span>, which here means "to remain as is". Thus this phrase means "it naturally became such that they were unable to remain respectfully quiet".
<br><span lang="ja">心の中に思ふこと</span> means exactly what it looks like: "what they felt in their hearts". <span lang="ja">隠す</span> also means "hide" as usual. The tricky part here is that the -i <span lang="ja">あふ</span> form is using <span lang="ja">堪ふ</span> instead of <span lang="ja">会ふ</span>, so <span lang="ja">隠しあへず</span> means "cannot endure hiding". The <span lang="ja">なむ</span> is emphatic.
<br>Finally, <span lang="ja">睦れ</span> means "intimately" (recall <span lang="ja">睦まじい</span>) and this <span lang="ja">きこゆ</span> is one of the many meaning "say" rather than "hear". The -i <span lang="ja">たまふ</span> is just formality, and -i <span lang="ja">ける</span> is past tense. So this part means "they spoke intimately".
<br>Expert Translation to Modern Japanese: <span lang="ja">お互いに胸の中のことも包みきれず話し合うといった具合に、親しみ申されるのであった。</span>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Old Japanese: 「<span lang="ja">その片かどなき人はあらむや</span>」<span lang="ja">とのたまへば、</span>「<span lang="ja">いとさばかりならむあたりには、誰（たれ）かはすかされ寄りはべらむ。</span>」
<br>Step-by-step Parsing: <span lang="ja">片かど</span> is <span lang="ja">片才</span>, meaning a meager talent/skill. <span lang="ja">片かどなき</span> thus means "without even the slightest talent". The -a mu form indicates likelihood since the subject is third person. Notice that <span lang="ja">や</span> marks a question here. So this part means "Is it probable for such a talentless/worthless person to exist?"
<br>The <span lang="ja">のたまふ</span> means <span lang="ja">おっしゃる</span>. Remember the -e <span lang="ja">ば</span> is not "if" but "because".
<br><span lang="ja">いと</span> means "very". <span lang="ja">さばかり</span> means <span lang="ja">それほど</span>. <span lang="ja">あたり</span> means what you think it does. In this case, the -a mu form is best read as <span lang="ja">という</span>, and <span lang="ja">さばかりならむ</span> is referring to the phrase <span lang="ja">片かどなき</span> in the previous quote. So the literal is "a (hypothetical) place that is _ to such a great degree". Plug in the reference and this becomes "a (hypothetical) place with such a worthless person".
<br>In context, this is Genji and his caretaker talking about court ladies in the imperial palace, so what this phrase really means is "a place with such a worthless woman".
<br><span lang="ja">誰（たれ）</span> still means "who?", the pronunciation is just older. <span lang="ja">すかす</span> means <span lang="ja">うまいこといってだます</span>. <span lang="ja">寄る</span> still means "to visit", and <span lang="ja">はべる</span> is simply a formal verb. Once again, the -a mu is likelihood. This adds up to "Who would be deceived into visiting (such a place)?"
<br>Expert Translation to Modern Japanese: <span lang="ja">源氏は</span>「<span lang="ja">一つの取り柄もないという人がいるものだろうか</span>」<span lang="ja">とおっしゃると、中将は、</span>「<span lang="ja">まったく、それほどひどい女がいるとしたら、そんな所には、誰がだまされて寄りつきますか。</span>」
