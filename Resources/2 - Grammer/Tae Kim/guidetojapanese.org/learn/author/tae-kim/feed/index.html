<p>I&#8217;m back! Most of you probably don&#8217;t know this (or care) but I actually have a real full-time job. And this being Japan, full-time means more like 9 to 8 rather than 9 to 5. So those of you who think I sit at home in my boxers working on my computer, I&#8217;m actually stuffed in a crowded train disguised amongst hundreds of Japanese businessman. And since our project is running late on the release date, I&#8217;m working more like 9 to 10&#8230; and I don&#8217;t mean one hour. No really. マジで。 And I suppose that&#8217;s just as good as any lead-in to the topic at hand: &#8220;How to use マジ to talk about what&#8217;s real.&#8221;</p>
<h2>What is マジ?</h2>
<p>Once you start practicing Japanese with real people outside of the classroom, you&#8217;re bound to run into the word 「まじ」 probably sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>You probably already know 「本当」, the word you use when you want to say things like, &#8220;Really?&#8221; or &#8220;Yes, really.&#8221; But most of the time, you don&#8217;t want to sound like a wimp by saying things like, &#8220;Oh really? That&#8217;s nice.&#8221; What you really want to say is something like, &#8220;For real?&#8221; or &#8220;No way!&#8221; or maybe even, &#8220;You&#8217;re shitting me!&#8221;. That&#8217;s where 「まじ」 comes in. 「まじ」 is often said to be a shortened form of 「真面目」 which means &#8220;to be serious&#8221; (although there are other theories regarding its origin). 「まじ」 is also often written in katakana to show that great emphasis that 「マジ」 contains.</p>
<blockquote><p>A: クリス、彼女ができたんだって。<br />
&#8211; I hear Chris got a girlfriend.</p>
<p>B: へ～、<em>マジ</em>？<br />
&#8211; Heh, for real?</p></blockquote>
<h2>Using the 「で」 Particle for マジ</h2>
<p>One thing to remember in terms of grammar is the use of particles. When you use 「本当」 as an adverb, you attach 「に」. However, for 「マジ」 you attach 「で」. There&#8217;s no logic that I can figure out to this but then we are talking about slang here.</p>
<blockquote><p>A: <em>本当に</em>忙しくて大変だったよ。<br />
&#8211; I was really busy and it was tough</p>
<p>B: そうなの？<br />
&#8211; Is that so?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>A: あいつ、<em>マジで</em>退学しちゃったの？<br />
&#8211; Did that guy really drop out of school?</p>
<p>B: うん、<em>マジで</em>。<br />
&#8211; Yeah, for real.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Differences between 「本当」 and 「マジ」</h2>
<p>Besides the difference in the particles, 「本当」 and 「マジ」 are quite different in their tone and usage. For instance, 「本当」 sounds cuter, more polite, and more feminine than 「マジ」 which sounds very rough and crude. In fact, you should take care in using 「マジ」 with your superiors. Having said that, I think 「マジ」 is a really useful word to know that you&#8217;re going to hear over and over again in daily conversations.</p>

<p>One of my pet peeves is when somebody says the phrase &#8220;learn Kanji&#8221; such as, &#8220;I learned 100 Kanji in one week!&#8221; Kanji has way too many parts to simply say that you &#8220;learned&#8221; it. Saying you learned Kanji is like saying &#8220;I learned computer!&#8221; or &#8220;I learned a car!&#8221; What does that even mean? Let&#8217;s break down the concrete things you <i>can</i> learn with Kanji.</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn the meaning(s)</li>
<li>Learn all the readings</li>
<li>Learn the stroke order</li>
<li>Learn how to write it</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s see how useful all these possibilities are for learning Japanese.</p>
<h2>Learn the meaning &#8211; Useful</h2>
<p>Learning the meaning of a Kanji is great if it&#8217;s a word by itself. For example, 「力」 is also a word  meaning &#8220;strength&#8221; so the meaning directly translates into a word you can actually use. However, you can also argue that since 「力」 is also a word, you are essentially saying that you learned the meaning of a word. So in the end, this is really the same as learning words and doesn&#8217;t really count as &#8220;learning Kanji&#8221;.</p>
<p>Having said that, knowing the meaning of a Kanji is certainly very useful for simpler words and concepts. Memorizing the meaning for Kanji such as 「続」 or 「連」 will definitely help you remember words such as 接続、連続、and 連中. In conclusion, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with learning the meaning of a Kanji and something I would recommend.</p>
<h2>Learn all the readings &#8211; Waste of time</h2>
<p>To put it bluntly, learning all the readings of a Kanji is a complete waste of time. Yes, as a general rule of thumb, Kanji compounds use the on-reading while single characters use the kun-reading. However, this rule is nowhere consistent enough to make it more than a good guess (this is particularly true for 大 which we can&#8217;t seem to decide to read as おお or だい).</p>
<p>In addition, many Kanji have multiple readings kun or on-readings such as 怪力(かいりき or かいりょく?), 外道(げどう or がいどう?), or 家路(いえじ、うちじ、やじ?). Even if you guessed the correct reading, it might be voiced or shortened such as 活発 and 発展. Also, Kanji such as 生 have so many readings, it&#8217;s completely pointless to memorize them because you won&#8217;t know which one will be used in a word such as 芝生、生ビール、生粋、and 生涯. Not to mention the various words that only use the Kanji for the meaning while completely ignoring the reading. These words such as 仲人、素人、and お土産 are literally impossible to guess the readings for. At the end of the day, if you see a new word, you always want to look up the reading to make sure you learn the correct combination. In addition, the readings will be easier to remember in context of real words that you can actually use. Essentially, memorizing the readings by themselves is a complete waste of time.</p>
<h2>Learn the stroke order &#8211; Essential at first</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to go into all the reasons why memorizing the correct stroke order is important. Without going into detail, of course you want to make sure to remember the correct stroke order. However, you&#8217;ll find that once you&#8217;ve mastered the basics and all the radicals, stroke order for most Kanji are consistent and easy enough that you no longer need to look it up. Every once in a while, you&#8217;ll run into odd Kanji such as 飛 or 鬱 where you&#8217;ll want to check the stroke order. So yes, definitely look up the stroke order and make sure you&#8217;re not developing any bad habits until&#8230; you don&#8217;t need to look them up anymore. That happens sooner that you might think.</p>
<h2>Learn how to write it &#8211; Depends</h2>
<p>This is going to be a controversial stance but nowadays, technology has progressed to the point where we never really have to write anything by hand anymore. Yes, it&#8217;s embarrassing if you&#8217;re fluent in a language but can&#8217;t write it by hand. This is an issue even for Japanese people.</p>
<p>By &#8220;writing Kanji&#8221;, I don&#8217;t mean just 2,000+ characters based on keywords. Unless you know which combination of Kanji to use for any given word with the correct okurigana, that is a useless parlor trick.</p>
<p>Being able to write any <i>word</i> in Kanji is an extremely time-consuming goal that may not have much practical value. If your daily life requires writing a lot by hand such as teaching Japanese, I feel that necessity and practice would naturally lend to better writing ability. In other words, if you don&#8217;t need it, it&#8217;s extremely difficult to keep up your memory of how to write Kanji by hand.</p>
<p>However, that is not to say you should never bother practicing writing in general. For beginners, it&#8217;s highly recommended to practice writing in general (especially kana!) in order to help develop muscle memory for stroke order as well as getting a sense of proper character balance.</p>
<h2>Conclusion &#8211; Learn words with Kanji!</h2>
<p>I hate the phrase &#8220;learn Kanji&#8221; because almost every time someone says that, they don&#8217;t realize that they haven&#8217;t really learned anything that&#8217;s directly applicable to Japanese. Compare &#8220;learning Kanji&#8221; to learning a word. In order to learn a word, you obviously need to learn the definition, reading, Kanji, and any Okurigana if applicable. There is no question of what you learned and whether it&#8217;s useful for Japanese. And yet the idea of learning 2,000 Kanji is so attractive that we can&#8217;t seem to get away from that broadly undefined notion.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t consider a Kanji as being learned until I know the most common words using that Kanji with the correct readings and can write those words randomly months after I initially memorized it. Unfortunately, given that standard, I probably know about 100-200 Kanji but hey, we all need goals, right?</p>
<p>Whatever cool method to &#8220;memorize Kanji&#8221; someone tries to peddle you, at the end of the day, you still have to do lots of reading and memorizing tons of vocabulary. This involves daily struggles starting with remembering that 「き」 in 「好き」 is okurigana and continuing with which Kanji to use for 真剣 vs 試験 vs 検査 vs 険しい, or constantly forgetting which kanji is for net vs rope （網／綱）. You may be thinking, &#8220;Wow, 2,000 is a lot!&#8221; But don&#8217;t worry, it pales in comparison to the tens of thousands of words that an adult has memorized in her lifetime. And believe it or not, having a fixed set of characters with mnemonics and compounds actually helps with the much bigger job of learning vocabulary. Once you&#8217;ve learned a new word in seconds based on characters you already know, you&#8217;ll know what I mean. Trust me.</p>
<h2>Addendum: Learning the radicals</h2>
<p>Many of the simpler and common characters such as 口 are also radicals that are used as parts of more complicated characters. Obviously you want to learn those as words by themselves. However, there are some radicals that are not characters on their own, for example, 儿 or 辶.</p>
<p>Memorizing them if it helps is fine, especially those that are conceptually easy to visualize such as 儿 for &#8220;legs&#8221;. In particular, you should learn to recognize when they are derivatives of actual Kanji such as 亻 from 人 and 忄 from 心. A common example is to remember the person radical 亻 next to a temple 寺 as meaning &#8220;samurai&#8221; （侍）. Learning the radical meaning will really help differentiate from other similar Kanji with different radicals eg 「時持詩待特」.</p>
<p>However, I personally can never remember some of the more abstract ones such as 攵 so while useful, I wouldn&#8217;t go full speed and memorize every single radical in existence. Again, learning in context and with actual words is your best bet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Originally published: 2015/12/4</p></blockquote>
<p>Q: What&#8217;s the best way to learn Japanese?<br />
A: It depends.</p>
<p>Q: What&#8217;s the best way to learn Kanji?<br />
A: The question is <a href="https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/you-cant-learn-kanji/">vague</a>.</p>
<p>Q: How long until I can become fluent?<br />
A: What does &#8220;fluent&#8221; mean? Also, it depends.</p>
<p>I get very short emails of this kind all the time and I usually don&#8217;t respond (sorry if this was you). But really, 99% of these generic, vague  questions I can answer: &#8220;It depends&#8221;.</p>
<h1>Time Management</h1>
<p>Learning a language is a big job. You&#8217;ve been practicing and learning for pretty much your entire life starting with your parents, to school, and all the way up to adulthood and beyond.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t believe the stupid &#8220;fluent in 3 months!&#8221; marketing lies of various paid products (who does really?) and be prepared for a long term significant time commitment. There are countless strategies for maintaining dedication and achieving goals, which I&#8217;m not going to get into because different approaches work better for different people.</p>
<p>What I can say definitely based on basic memorization principles is that it&#8217;s far better to spend a little time regularly rather than a large chunk with big gaps of neglect. The best way to achieve this is to integrate Japanese into your daily schedule.</p>
<p>Personally, I did a lot of studying back in the old days when I had literally nothing better to do (no TV or internet). Nowadays, with smartphones, there&#8217;s obviously a lot more distractions to deal with. Depending on your schedule, try to find a regular time that you can dedicate such as your commute or scheduling conversation practice once a week.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Allocate a regular time in your schedule
</p></blockquote>
<p>It would be even more ideal if you can take one of your existing hobbies or interest and apply Japanese to it. The obvious example would be switching media such as music, movies, TV, books, and games to Japanese, perhaps with subtitles. Even if you spend an hour or so browsing on the internet or social media, consider watching Japanese Youtube videos or joining some Japanese Facebook group for example.</p>
<p>Of course, language is a tool for communication so you also want to make sure you&#8217;re not holed up by yourself and that you get out and socialize (more on this later). Ultimately, it&#8217;s very important that your &#8220;study&#8221; is enjoyable and provides some degree of satisfaction and positive feedback in order to prevent burn out and giving up.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Make it fun!
</p></blockquote>
<h1>Prioritization</h1>
<p>Assuming you are able to devote some amount of time on a regular basis, there&#8217;s still the issue that you have a lot of catching up to do compared to a native adult who has a head start of 2+ decades of education and immersion. So it&#8217;s time to set some priorities and have realistic expectations.</p>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t set priorities, they will get set whether you like it or not. Of course like you (I hope), I strive to be natively proficient at everything but frankly, my writing skills can use work, a LOT of work. That&#8217;s because instead of writing in Japanese, I&#8217;m spending my time writing this blog post in English and mostly reading. Even though I can naively wish my writing would magically improve, it won&#8217;t happen unless I work on it (I&#8217;m not).</p>
<p>So if you need Japanese for your work, have family, interested in anime or whatever, you can easily break it down into one of four skills:  listening, speaking, reading, writing. Once you have your priorities, you need to work on improving those skills by actually DOING IT.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Triage and focus on one of:</p>
<ol>
<li>listening</li>
<li>reading</li>
<li>speaking</li>
<li>writing</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>However, when it comes to output skills, you need input otherwise you&#8217;re just making up random nonsense. So if you want to work on speaking, start by listening, reading before writing (about 2-4 times more input over output).</p>
<blockquote><p>2-4X input over output:</p>
<ul>
listening > speaking<br />
reading > writing</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, even if you triage (which will happen regardless), you should still work on the other areas. Our brains are a complex neural network and stimulating different parts of it helps retention. So if you spend all your time buried in a book, get out and talk to some people. If you&#8217;re just winging it in Japan, go home and do some reading.</p>
<p>Having a visual image of an object for example, a &#8220;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%E8%87%AA%E5%8B%95%E8%B2%A9%E5%A3%B2%E6%A9%9F&#038;hl=ja&#038;biw=1400&#038;bih=819&#038;site=webhp&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwjH1qfmj8PJAhVM7WMKHT4lAIcQ_AUIBigB">vending machine</a>&#8221; with the Kanji 自動販売機 &#8220;self moving sell machine&#8221; after hearing the word in conversations is the best way to cement it in long-term memory.</p>
<blockquote><p>Maintain a good balance</p></blockquote>
<h1>Counter examples</h1>
<p>Take these stereotypical examples and it&#8217;s easy to see where the problems lie because priorities were not in line with desired result.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stopped studying Japanese because &#8220;busy with life&#8221;<br />
Spends several hours watching Youtube on the weekend.</li>
<li>Advanced Japanese student who can&#8217;t hold a conversation<br />
Didn&#8217;t actually spend time outside classroom speaking to people.</li>
<li>Cannot speak with Japanese significant other<br />
Always speaks in English with significant other. Has some excuse for not studying or reading.</li>
<li>Loves anime, can&#8217;t understand a word<br />
English subtitles always on. Doesn&#8217;t spend time looking up the words. Doesn&#8217;t read manga or light novel with a dictionary.</li>
<li>Can&#8217;t write Kanji by hand (this is me)<br />
Always uses an electronic device to type. Rarely writes by hand.</li>
<li>Can&#8217;t write that novel in Japanese<br />
Writes English blog post about learning priorities (yeah you know who you are).</li>
<li>Grammar is confusing<br />
Didn&#8217;t read <a href="https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar">my book</a> (shameless plug).</li>
</ol>

<p>This post is about how you shouldn&#8217;t be reading this post.</p>
<p>Still here? Tsk tsk.</p>
<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been wrestling with how much English vs Japanese to use in my guide. The more Japanese there is to read, the better. However, if there&#8217;s too much, it will be too difficult and overwhelming, which would be counter-productive.</p>
<p>If your Japanese study material consists of mostly reading in your native language, you might want to try something that has more Japanese text. This post is in English as well, so really, you probably should stop reading and spend your time on something more productive.</p>
<p>When I first started writing the grammar guide, I wanted to cover every possible topic. Today however, my goal is to kick you out of the bird&#8217;s nest so to speak but perhaps a bit more gently than a sink-or-swim approach. I certainly DO NOT expect visitors to be reading about every nuance in grammar or vocabulary in English, especially those who have already mastered the basics. My primary goal is to cover the core concepts and illustrate <i>how to teach yourself</i> and maybe even have some fun in the process. Teach a man to fish and all that jazz.</p>
<p>So, if you understand all the particles, sentence structure, and how to use dictionaries to learn new vocabulary, maybe it&#8217;s time to consider trying to fly out of the nest. Take your time though, I won&#8217;t kick you out!</p>

<p>「切れる」, the <a href="https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/in-transitive">intransitive version</a> of 「切る」, not to be confused with the short-hand <a href="https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/potential">potential form</a> 「切られる」, is one of those common words with many definitions and usages.</p>
<p>If you look up 「切れる」 on Jim Breen&#8217;s WWWJDIC, you will get a huge list of definitions:</p>
<blockquote><p>切れる 【きれる】 (v1) (1) to cut well; to be sharp; (2) to break (off); to snap; to wear out; (3) to be injured; (4) to burst; to collapse; (5) to be disconnected; to be out of; to expire; to sever (connections) with; (6) to be shrewd; to have a sharp mind;</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re just starting out, I would NOT recommend using these definitions verbatim. It&#8217;s important to see how it&#8217;s used in context in order to see the specific types of situations and common particles used together. Let&#8217;s take a look at some examples.</p>
<p>For instance, what if you wanted to say something ran out or expired?</p>
<blockquote><p>１）電池がもうすぐ<em>切れる</em>から、新しいのを買った方がいい。<br />
&#8211; The batteries are going to run out soon, so you should buy a new one.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>２）この商品はもう<em>売り切れ</em>です。<br />
&#8211; This item is already sold-out.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>３）賞味期限がもう<em>切れた</em>から、捨てた方がいいよ。<br />
&#8211; The sell-by date has already expired so you should throw it out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or what if your connection gets cut off such as on the phone?</p>
<blockquote><p>１）トンネルに入ったら、電波が届かなくて電話が<em>切れた</em>。<br />
&#8211; Once entering the tunnel, the signal didn&#8217;t reach and the phone got cut off.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can even use it for when you lose your temper.</p>
<blockquote><p>１）もう我慢できなくて、<em>切れた</em>。<br />
&#8211; I couldn&#8217;t take it anymore and I lost my temper.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps, one of the most useful thing about 「切れる」 is that you can take the negative and use it as a verb suffix for things you can&#8217;t cut off and put an end to. This has a similar meaning to the expression 「切りがない」 for things that have no cut-off point and seems to be endless. As you can see by the examples, you just take the <a href="https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/polite#The_stem_of_verbs">stem</a> of the verb and attach 「きれない」 .</p>
<blockquote><p>１）こんなにたくさん<em>食べきれない</em>よ。<br />
&#8211; I can&#8217;t eat this much (you know).</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>２）どう頑張っても、この宿題は絶対<em>やりきれない</em>よ。<br />
&#8211; No matter how much you try, there&#8217;s no way you will finish this homework.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>３）状況はまだ把握<em>しきれてない</em>ため、明日まで検討させてください。<br />
&#8211; Because I haven&#8217;t finished getting a handle on the situation, please let me consider/investigate until tomorrow.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Originally Published: 2005/2/16</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned this before, but I&#8217;d like to repeat myself here to hopefully help the debunking of the age-old Japanese sentence order myth.</p>
<p>Many of you have probably heard this before but to review, here&#8217;s how the myth goes.</p>
<p>An English sentence must consist of at least a subject, verb, and object in that order. However, in Japanese, the order must be subject, object, then verb.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Myth</b><br />
English sentence order = [Subject] [Verb] [Object]<br />
Japanese sentence order = [Subject] [Object] [Verb] </p></blockquote>
<p>I can debunk this myth is 2 seconds. Let&#8217;s see, is this sentence correct?</p>
<blockquote><p>１）<span title="りんご- apple" class="popup">林檎</span>を<span title="わたし - me, myself, I" class="popup">私</span>が<span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べた。</span><br /> -Apple I ate.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Why, yes it is. And look, the object appears to come before the subject. Boy, that was easy.</p>
<p>There are several misleading things about this myth besides the fact that it&#8217;s just plain incorrect. First of all, as I&#8217;ve partially explained in a <a href="https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/difference-between-wa-and-ga/">previous post</a>, Japanese doesn&#8217;t require or even have anything equivalent to the English subject. In addition, you only need a verb to make a complete thought in Japanese.</p>
<blockquote><p>１）<span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べた</span>。<br /> -Ate.</p></blockquote>
<p>What gets tricky is that the state-of-being verb (the English verb &#8220;to be&#8221;) can be implicitly implied by a noun or adjective. That&#8217;s because Japanese doesn&#8217;t have an actual verb for the state-of-being.</p>
<blockquote><p>１）<span title="それ- that" class="popup">それ</span>は<span title="ざんねん - unfortunate" class="popup">残念</span>。<br /> -That [is] unfortunate.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Why Japanese doesn&#8217;t have strict sentence order</h2>
<p>In Japanese, we have things called particles that come after almost every word in the sentence to identify exactly what role that word is playing. That means that no matter where the word is in the sentence, we&#8217;ll know whether it&#8217;s an object, topic, identifier, target, context, etc.. The only reason sentence order is so strict in English is because without clear rules of ordering, we won&#8217;t have any idea which word is supposed to play which role.</p>
<blockquote><p>In English, sentence order changes the meaning of the sentence.<br />
１） Dog saw Tree.<br />
２）Tree saw Dog.</p>
<p>In Japanese, because of particles, no matter how you move things around, the dog is still the topic and the tree is still the object.<br />
１） Dog[topic particle]  tree[object particle]  saw. = Dog saw tree.<br />
２） Tree[object particle]  dog[topic particle]  saw. = Dog saw tree.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Clauses</h2>
<p>In order to really understand Japanese sentence structure, you need to break things down into clauses. A clause is the smallest part of a sentence that expresses a complete thought. As mentioned previously, in order to express a complete thought, you must have a verb or a noun/adjective that is a state-of-being.  Now, the only thing you have to remember is that everything that applies to that verb must come before it. And that each clause can have only one such verb.</p>
<blockquote><p>The verb (or state-of-being) must come at the very <u>end</u> of the clause</p>
<p>１）<span title="いぬ - dog" class="popup">犬</span>が<span title="き - tree" class="popup">木</span>を<u><span title="みる - to see" class="popup">見た</span></u>。 &#8211; The dog saw tree.<br />
２）<span title="き - tree" class="popup">木</span>を<span title="いぬ - dog" class="popup">犬</span>が<u><span title="みる - to see" class="popup">見た</span></u>。 &#8211; The dog saw tree.</p>
<p>１）<span title="わたし - me, myself, I" class="popup">私</span>は<u><span title="がくせい - student" class="popup">学生</span>です</u>。 &#8211; I am student.<br />
２）<span title="がくせい - student" class="popup">学生</span>は<u><span title="わたし - me, myself, I" class="popup">私</span>です</u>。 &#8211; The student is me.</p></blockquote>
<h2>That&#8217;s it!</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, that&#8217;s really the only thing you have to worry about in terms of Japanese sentence ordering. It&#8217;s one of the great benefits of particles actually because sentence order no longer defines a word&#8217;s function.</p>
<blockquote><p>All of the following sentences are correct.<br />
１）<span title="かれ - he; boyfriend" class="popup">彼</span>は<span title="いつも - always" class="popup">いつも</span><span title="としょかん - library" class="popup">図書館</span>で<u><span title="べんきょう - study" class="popup">勉強</span><span title="する - to do" class="popup">する</span></u>。<br />
２）<span title="いつも - always" class="popup">いつも</span><span title="としょかん - library" class="popup">図書館</span>で<span title="かれ - he; boyfriend" class="popup">彼</span>は<u><span title="べんきょう - study" class="popup">勉強</span><span title="する - to do" class="popup">する</span></u>。<br />
３）<span title="としょかん - library" class="popup">図書館</span>で<span title="かれ - he; boyfriend" class="popup">彼</span>は<span title="いつも - always" class="popup">いつも</span><u><span title="べんきょう - study" class="popup">勉強</span><span title="する - to do" class="popup">する</span></u>。</p></blockquote>
<p>It is also important to realize that the farther away you get from the main verb, the more extraneous the information becomes. In sentence １, the sentence is mostly centered on the fact that the studying is done at the library while in sentence ３, the focus is on the fact that he <i>always</i> studies.</p>
<p>In order to make more complicated sentences, you can take separate clauses and combine them with either with <a href="https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/compound">conjunctions </a> or by <a href="https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/clause">direct noun modifications</a>.  But as long as the sentence structure in each separate clause is correct, there should be no problems with sentence ordering no matter how complicated and long the sentence is.</p>
<h2>Addendum</h2>
<p>(added 2017/10/19)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure linguistic experts will claim I&#8217;m totally wrong and SOV is a classification, word order preference, or whatever you want to call it and doesn&#8217;t technically require an &#8220;S&#8221; or &#8220;O&#8221;. My original point in the article (though admittedly I was younger and more dramatic) is that this classification doesn&#8217;t help SLA and in fact creates a lot of confusion and common mistakes for beginners learning Japanese as a second language.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a BIG stretch to say there&#8217;s some equivalence to English as an SVO language. In English, saying &#8220;Ball boy hits&#8221; is grammatically incorrect. On the other hand, in Japanese, not only are both &#8220;Ball boy hits&#8221; and &#8220;Boy ball hits&#8221; grammatically correct, they <i>have the same meaning</i> if the particles remain unchanged regardless of order. There&#8217;s a fundamental difference in the two languages that is not accurately portrayed by this misleading classification.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I believe the whole viewpoint of SOV vs SVO linguistically is very western-centric and not a good way to describe Japanese. If you want to prove me wrong with a mathematical proof in the style of formal language theory, that&#8217;s one thing but this is far more subjective and to say one is &#8220;wrong&#8221; because it doesn&#8217;t adhere to an established curriculum is short-sighted. I highly doubt linguistics created in a vacuum purely for Japanese would have taken the same approach here.</p>

<p>While the word 「てき」 usually means &#8220;enemy&#8221;, that&#8217;s not the word we&#8217;re talking about today.  The word I&#8217;m going to talk about uses a completely different Kanji from 「敵」 meaning &#8220;enemy&#8221;  and is in fact a very useful and helpful ally.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve studied Japanese for a while, you&#8217;re bound to have encountered the 「的」 kanji. While this kanji by itself is read as 「まと」 and means a &#8220;target&#8221;, its usefulness really shines as a noun suffix. This kanji can be attached to countless nouns to easily change them to a <a href="https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/complete/adjectives">na-adjective</a>.  In this case, you read the kanji as 「てき」 and you&#8217;ll see it all over the place: 一般的、圧倒的、感動的、習慣的、技術的、基本的、and on and on.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take the word 「感動」 meaning &#8220;deep emotion&#8221; and say we want to say the following sentence.</p>
<blockquote><p>That movie was very moving.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, since 「感動」 is a noun, we can&#8217;t just say, 「あの映画はとても感動」 because the movie is not a deep emotion. So you&#8217;re going to have to say something complicated like the following:</p>
<blockquote><p> あの映画を見て、感動した。<br />
I saw that movie and I was moved.</p></blockquote>
<p>But wait! We can just use 「的」 to make 「感動」 into an adjective!</p>
<blockquote><p> あの映画は<em>感動的</em>だった。<br />
That movie was very moving.</p>
<p>あれは<em>感動的な</em>映画だった。<br />
That was a very moving movie.</p></blockquote>
<p>What could be argued as even more useful is if you use the <a href="https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/complete/verb_particles#_Target_Particle">「に」 target particle</a> with 「的」, you can make the noun into an adverb!  (Actually, this applies to <a href="https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/complete/adverbs">all na-adjectives</a>)</p>
<blockquote><p>それは技術的<em>に</em>無理です。<br />
That&#8217;s technically impossible.</p>
<p>朝ご飯は習慣的<em>に</em>毎朝食べます。<br />
I customarily eat breakfast every morning.</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, without 「的」 there are just so many things that can&#8217;t be expressed. I would definitely put this kanji on my top 100 list.</p>
<blockquote><p>アメリカでは、車で通勤するのが<em>一般的</em>だ。<br />
In America, people generally commute by car.</p>
<p><em>客観的な</em>視点から考えたほうがいい。<br />
It&#8217;s better to think of it from a objective viewpoint.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Originally published: 2007/9/3</p></blockquote>
<p>One of my biggest pet peeves in the field of Japanese as a second language is the 「が」 particle being called the &#8220;subject particle&#8221;. This misleading terminology comes from my second biggest pet peeve, which is educators trying to artificially tie Japanese into English language concepts. I think one of the problems is that Japanese teachers, especially native speakers, really don&#8217;t understand their own language from a conceptual point-of-view and more importantly how it logically differs from English.</p>
<p>I can illustrate how <i>stupid</i> it is to call 「が」 the subject particle in the following simple dialogue.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Ａさん： 原宿に行こうよ。<br />
Ｂさん： なんで？<br />
Ａさん：　<em>クレープが</em>食べたいから。</p></blockquote>
<p>Looking at the last sentence, if 「クレープが」 is indeed marking crepe as the subject, we can only assume that Ａさん wants to go to Harajuku because the crepe wants to eat. But that doesn&#8217;t make any sense! In reality, 「クレープ」 here is supposed to be the object of the sentence, the subject being Ａさん, who wants to eat crepe.</p>
<p>The most simple conclusion, if you insist on thinking in English, is that the 「が」 particle can either represent the subject or the object of the sentence. But why would you use the same particle to represent something completely so different as the subject and the object? And to make things even worse, consider the following dialogue.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Ａさん：何か食べようよ。<br />
Ｂさん：クレープはどう？<br />
Ａさん：<em>クレープは</em>あまり食べたくないな。</p></blockquote>
<p>If you throw in the fact that the 「は」 can also be the subject OR the object, it&#8217;s no wonder that Japanese particles seem so confusing! It&#8217;s natural that students can never figure out the difference between 「は」 and 「が」 because it seems that either can be used to indicate the same things in English. This is where Japanese teachers should really beat into their heads that the concepts they&#8217;re looking for such as the subject <i>does not exist</i> in Japanese.</p>
<p>The subject traditionally indicates who or what is doing the verb in the sentence but 「は」 only indicates the topic. For example, 「今日は忙しい」 doesn&#8217;t mean that &#8220;Today is busy&#8221;, it means &#8220;As for today, [I, he, she, we, they] is/are busy.&#8221; Only when we translate into English are we forced to create the subject by context. In this case, the translation might be &#8220;I&#8217;m busy today.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 「が」 particle also does not indicate the subject, it only identifies the unknown. For example, 「クレープが食べたいから。」 is identifying that it&#8217;s because crepe is the thing that he/she/we/they wants to eat. In English, the subject would be &#8220;it&#8221; as in, &#8220;<u>It&#8217;s</u> because I want to eat crepe&#8221;. But because Japanese doesn&#8217;t even have a subject, there is no need for such a construction.</p>
<p>This is why I&#8217;ve been calling the 「が」 particle the &#8220;identifier particle&#8221; for the longest time, and you should too because that&#8217;s what it does. There is no such thing as a subject in Japanese so it makes no sense to have a &#8220;subject&#8221; particle. (Please feel free to do the double quote sign while saying &#8220;subject&#8221; in &#8220;subject particle&#8221;.)</p>
<p>For further reading, I highly suggest this blog post: 「<a href="http://lib21.blog96.fc2.com/blog-entry-665.html">日本語に主語はあるのか？</a>」.</p>

While the word &#8220;basic&#8221; has a connotation of meaning &#8220;easy&#8221; (eg Visual Basic), this is not the case for Japanese. The most basic ideas in Japanese are the hardest to grasp because the fundamental differences between English and Japanese leaves out any way to actually express the idea in English. Unless you speak a similar language like Korean *eh hem*, you&#8217;re going to have to wrestle with a concept that doesn&#8217;t even exist in your native language. One such example is the idea of particles and especially the particles 「は」 and 「が」.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s the difference between 「は」 and 「が」?</h2>
<p>I wish I had a nickel for every time I heard the question, &#8220;What is the difference between the 「は」 and 「が」 particle?&#8221; This question has successfully managed to baffle countless generations of people learning Japanese.  This has been followed by countless number of <a href="http://japanese.about.com/library/weekly/aa051301a.htm">equally confusing (and sometimes wrong) explanations</a> involving a great deal of mumbo-jumbo such as contrast, emphasis, subordinate clauses, and voodoo magic. However, with my genius, I was able to provide a complete explanation in one small sentence.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>「は」 and 「が」 have different meanings.</b></p></blockquote>
<p>I think the more appropriate question would be, &#8220;What <b>isn&#8217;t</b> different about 「は」 and 「が」?&#8221; You may be thinking, &#8220;But in English, they both identify the subject of the sentence.&#8221; Ahh, English. Isn&#8217;t English that language that can&#8217;t even express the very concept of 「は」 and 「が」? Well, no wonder it looks the same in <b>that</b> language. That&#8217;s like a red-green color-blind person holding a red and green sheet of paper and saying, &#8220;Hey, isn&#8217;t this the same color?&#8221;</p>
<h2>Japanese: A language of context</h2>
<p>Since 「は」 and 「が」 mean totally different things, the only thing we need to do in order to identify their differences is to fully understand what they actually mean and why they exist. The first thing we need to realize is that a Japanese sentence is not required to have a subject. You can just say, &#8220;Hit ball&#8221; and you&#8217;re good to go.  So how do you know what the heck everybody is talking about?</p>
<p>Well, there are several ways and they all involve making assumptions from context.  For example, if I suddenly asked you, &#8220;Ate lunch?&#8221; you assume I&#8217;m asking if <b>you</b> ate lunch because I&#8217;m surely not talking about anyone else. Therefore, you answer, &#8220;Ate lunch.&#8221; Then I assume you are talking about yourself since I just asked you the question and so I now know that you ate lunch. However, if we happened to be talking about Alice when I asked you the question, you will likely assume that I&#8217;m asking if Alice ate lunch because that&#8217;s who we were talking about.</p>
<h2>Ok, so what does 「は」 mean?</h2>
<p>If we take a language like Japanese where the subject is so heavily based on context, we need to be able to identify a couple things. While making assumptions from context will work for simple question and answer sessions, anything more complicated will soon become a mess as everybody starts to lose track of who or what they&#8217;re talking about. Therefore, we need to be able to tell the listener when we want to change the current topic to say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m going to talk about <b>this</b> now. So don&#8217;t assume I&#8217;m still talking about the old thing.&#8221; This is especially important when you strike up a new conversation and you need to tell the listener what you&#8217;re talking about. This is what the 「は」 particle does; it introduces a different topic from the current one. For that reason, it is also referred to as the &#8216;topic particle&#8217;.</p>
<p>Lets take the previous example where I wanted to ask you if you ate. The conversation might look like the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Me) <span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べた</span>？ &#8211; Did <em>you</em> eat?<br />
You) <span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べた</span>。 &#8211; I ate.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, what if I wanted to ask you if Alice ate? Then I need to use the 「は」 particle to indicate that I&#8217;m talking about Alice. Otherwise, you would just assume I&#8217;m talking about you.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Me) アリス<em>は</em><span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べた</span>？ &#8211; Did <em>Alice</em> eat?<br />
You) <span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べた</span>。 &#8211; She ate.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice how once I establish Alice as the new topic, we can continue to assume that we are talking about her until someone changes the topic.</p>
<h2>So what does 「が」 mean then?</h2>
<p>Ok, so we can introduce a new topic using the 「は」 particle. But what if we don&#8217;t know what the topic is? What if I wanted to ask, &#8220;Who ate the chicken?&#8221; What I need is some kind of <i>identifier</i> because I don&#8217;t know who ate the chicken. If I used the 「は」 particle, the question would become, &#8220;Did who eat the chicken?&#8221; and that doesn&#8217;t make any sense because &#8220;who&#8221; is not an actual person.</p>
<p>This is where the 「が」 particle comes into play. It is also referred to as the subject particle but I hate that name since it means something completely different in English grammar. Instead, I move to call it the <i>identifier</i> particle because it identifies something unknown.</p>
<p>The conversation about the chicken-eater culprit might go something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Me) <span title="だれ- who" class="popup">誰</span><em>が</em><span title="チキン - chicken" class="popup">チキン</span>を<span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べた</span>？ &#8211; Who ate the chicken?<br />
You) アリス<em>が</em><span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べた</span>。 &#8211; Alice [is the one who] ate it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice that the 「が」 particle is used twice because you need to identify who ate the chicken in the answer. You can&#8217;t say 「アリス<em>は</em><span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べた</span>。」 because we&#8217;re not talking about Alice. We&#8217;re trying to identify the unknown person that ate the chicken.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now, that I&#8217;ve clearly explained what 「は」 and 「が」 means, I hope this will finally clear up that question that has been haunting your mind. Remember, if you are talking about something new, use 「は」. If you are trying to identify something unknown, use 「が」. Simple, huh?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Learning Japanese words</h2>
<p>Learning the definitions of Japanese words is pretty straight-forward if you know how to find the Kanji and know how to use an online or electronic Japanese-English vocabulary as we saw in a <a href="https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/resources/findingkanji">previous tutorial</a>. But can you really say you learned what the word means? Well, you can probably safely say you&#8217;ve learned what the word means in the context that you&#8217;re learning it in.</p>
<p>For example, if you look up the word 「乗る」 using let&#8217;s say jisho.org, you get <a href="http://jisho.org/words?jap=%E4%B9%97%E3%82%8B&#038;eng=&#038;dict=edict">this</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
1:  to get on; to ride in; to board; to mount; to get up on; (Godan verb with ru ending)<br />
2: to spread (paints); to be taken in; (Godan verb with ru ending)<br />
3: to share in; to join; to feel like doing; to be mentioned in; to be in harmony with
</p></blockquote>
<p>This verb is pretty straight-forward if you were looking it up in a context like the sentence below.</p>
<p>Example<br />
バスに乗る. &#8211; Ride bus.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty obvious that the verb means &#8220;to ride&#8221; here. But it&#8217;s a bit tougher to figure out a sentence like the one below without more context.</p>
<p>Example<br />
話に乗る。 &#8211; Ride story.</p>
<p>This is just a simple example of how it&#8217;s important to learn new words in context. If you were reading the sentence in context, you could probably figure out that 「話に乗る」 means to get on board with an idea or plan.</p>
<p>A great resource for finding phrases is http://www.alc.co.jp/. In this example, it has a direct translation of the <a href="http://eow.alc.co.jp/%E8%A9%B1%E3%81%AB%E4%B9%97%E3%82%8B/UTF-8/">whole phrase 「話に乗る」</a> along with example sentences.</p>
<blockquote><p>
* 話に乗る<br />
  bite<br />
* 君がこれに加わるなら（この話に乗るなら）、すぐに話をしなければならない。<br />
  If you&#8217;re coming in on this, we&#8217;ve gotta start talking right now.<br />
* （～する）話に乗る<br />
  jump at the chance [opportunity] (to)<br />
* ～の話に乗る<br />
  go along with
</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, 「話に乗る」 doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;bite&#8221; in the literal sense of the word, so you should always read example sentences to see the full context.</p>
<h2>Translating English words</h2>
<p>When you start practicing your Japanese, you will often think of a word or concept that you don&#8217;t know how to express in Japanese. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s a lot trickier to find the correct Japanese for an English phrase than it is to learn the definition of a given Japanese word.</p>
<p>Before you try anything, do NOT try to translate very abstract or grammatical words such as &#8220;like&#8221;, &#8220;as&#8221;, and &#8220;for&#8221;. You should probably be asking a Japanese speaker how to express complete sentences and thoughts, not abstract words that likely won&#8217;t translate very well or not at all. However, if you need to find a translation for concrete, simple words like &#8220;car&#8221; or &#8220;biology&#8221;, you could try an English-Japanese dictionary. </p>
<p>First of all, do NOT use any dictionaries that only have Japanese-English （和英） dictionaries such as the WWWJDIC or jisho.org to look up English words. These dictionaries merely give you the illusion of an English-Japanese dictionary by searching within the English definitions of Japanese words often with disastrous results. It simply does NOT work.</p>
<p>Instead, use sites that have English-Japanese （英和） dictionaries like alc (http://www.alc.co.jp) or Yahoo! (http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/). If you search for &#8220;eat&#8221;, both dictionaries return 「食べる」 as you would expect. Japanese-English dictionaries return entries that I won&#8217;t even bother to reproduce here.</p>
<p>Personally, I prefer alc, as you can search whole phrases and idioms such as &#8220;eat my hat&#8221; and often get good results.</p>

<h2>Different Kanji for the same word</h2>
<p>You will often come upon a Kanji that has the exact same reading and an almost identical meaning to other similar words. Examples of this include the various ways you can write the verb &#8220;to see&#8221; which is 「みる」. This word can be written in 5 different Kanji each with a slight difference in meaning.</p>
<ol>
<li>見る 【み・る】 &#8211; to see</li>
<li>看る 【み・る】 &#8211; to see (as in to nurse)</li>
<li>観る 【み・る】 &#8211; to watch</li>
<li>視る 【み・る】 &#8211; to see (to investigate)</li>
<li>診る 【み・る】 &#8211; to see (to diagnose)</li>
</ol>
<p>For words that can be written with multiple Kanji, you can use the various dictionaries and example sentences to learn when to use which. Your Japanese input method editor can also be an excellent tool as the ones for OS X and Windows explain the differences between the different version when you select the Kanji.</p>
