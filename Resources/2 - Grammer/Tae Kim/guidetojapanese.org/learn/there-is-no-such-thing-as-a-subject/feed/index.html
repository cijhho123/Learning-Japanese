					<description><![CDATA[this might be a very strange and specific request but while we&#039;re on the topic of wa and ga can someone go to the last episode of season 4 of my hero academia and at 17:42 in the episode a news reporter lady says that &quot;endeavor ga tatakatte imasu&quot; and I&#039;ve spent hours thinking why it was &#039;ga&#039; was used and why it wasn&#039;t &quot;endeavor WA tatakatte imasu&quot; but I never reached a definitive answer. So, if someone could do that it&#039;d be really helpful.
Thanks]]></description>

I think what has been said so far is probably at the root of it... that you have to discard the whole concept of agency. The crepe isn&#039;t an agent, it is an influencer. Japanese verbs are best thought of as complete independent concepts which aren&#039;t locked to a &quot;doer&quot;. So 食べたい is simply a desire to eat. As the topic 私は you are the one that the desire exists in. As an influencer クレープが it stimulates the desire in the topic. Where as クレープを would simply be something (an objective) that the topic (you) would be willing to eat to satiate the desire, even though the crepe hasn&#039;t necessarily caused the desire. 
So, 私はクレープが食べたい。 is &quot;I want to eat a/the crepe.&quot; (it&#039;s the focus of my desire). But 私はクレープを食べたい。 is &quot;I could go for a crepe.&quot; (it&#039;s the best option available at the moment).
This whole thing drives me crazy too. It&#039;s so hard to drop the idea of agency as a native English speaker. But if you think of the concept of Japanese having influencers not agents, then you can make は and が make more sense. As long as you remember that は can become the default influencer if it&#039;s required by the verb. 
Basically you have to get a more nuanced understanding of what Japanese verbs (and adjectives) really mean, and what the&#039;re often paired with. Not just what they translate as in the dictionary. 
On the flip side I find many of my Japanese students have the same issue of trying to actually understand agency. They confuse their influencer concept with an agent. It becomes especially obvious when teaching auxiliary have.  
To sum up, an agent embodies the action. The action is a quality of the agent. Where as in Japanese everything is a quality of the activity and the stage where it takes place (if any) is は.]]></description>

“a crepe is a thing that is wanting to be eaten (by me)” seems too contrived of a translation to properly make sense, especially for a beginner trying to distinguish between は and が. In this sense the concept of identifying particle seems to be more natural and flexible then subject particle, and among more situations as well. On the other hand, maybe &quot;(a/the) crepe (is what is making me) want to eat (it)&quot; could be a good translation to understand it just the way you said, kinda like クレープが（それを私に）食べたくならさせている but leaving out what comes after 食べたい.

I also thought, what if you literally wanted to say “the crepe is wanting to be eaten (by me)&quot;? In that case you&#039;d need to say something like クレープは私が食べられてほしい, right? I know it sounds ridiculous but it left me wondering lol]]></description>

The thing is that sentences with &quot;sujeto tácito&quot; use the verb to imply the subject, at least in part (compare &quot;Comimos helado&quot; vs &quot;Comió helado&quot;, one possible subject vs three). In Japanese there is no way to indicate this with the verb alone, at least not without using long, nuanced sentences full of keigo and such.]]></description>

Hi,

Your website is pretty good for learning Japanese for beginners. However, I get stuck at the practice exercises. Without any context, it is damn difficult to know what the speakers are talking about and what to use in the blank spaces. As a result, I have to toggle the answers to see exactly what the sentence is all about.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would tend to agree, since the &quot;subject&quot; as we think of it in English is just implied but can&#039;t really be stated (at least not in this sentence... maybe there are some sentences where it is by chance closer to an English subject). 

But while I think &quot;subject marker&quot; is a confusing way to teach this, in a way it kind of works. You could write the full phrase as 「(私は)クレープが食べたいから」, where you could translate the implied subject as me: &quot;I think&quot;. But「クレープが食べたい」 is not really &quot;I want to eat a crepe&quot;, it&#039;s more like &quot;a crepe is a thing that is wanting to be eaten (by me)&quot;, in which case crepes are the subject. It took me a looong time to get this though, because no one seems to teach it this way. 

I agree that the talk of subject and object is confusing, just being honest about how weird it sounds to state the actual meaning of Japanese sentences in English, and vice versa, is a better method in my mind. Because there is so much everyday English-speaking culture and expression that is just not said in Japanese, and so many more expressions that we don&#039;t say (like ~てくれる/~てもらう to express thankfulness) that should be stated when speaking Japanese!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The crepe is a subject  and marked by ga as usual. However, it is impossible to translate the phrase faithfully into English. 
The ending -tai makes a verb into what usually but misleadingly is called an i-adjective.  These can function as predicates just as any ordinary verb can; something that is impossible in English. 
The Crepes make themselves desirable to be eaten.  The speaker is not the subject of the sentence he is the object  and this would be marked by ni. The best translation is probably: &quot;Because crepes are tasty&quot;. Crepes=subject are-tasty=predicate. &quot;Because I like crepes&quot; is not a faithful translation
I agree absolutely that there are problems in using Latin concepts when describing Japanese but in this case the problem is not in the subject per se  but in that English usage is misleading to who/what is the subject.   A-san may want to eat the crepes but that is not what he says, He is not telling anything about himself. He is speaking about how the crepes are. 
Keep up the good work! Your site is on of (maybe the) best but you should reconsider this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The agent is the performer of an action.
In many sentences, a word group is subject and agent at the same time. As in &quot;The cat eats the mouse&quot;, the cat is subject and agent at the same time.
But there are also plenty of sentences where subject != agent. Passive sentences are the most basic example : 
The mouse is eaten by the cat. Subject: the mouse. (subject of &quot;is eaten by the cat&quot;) Agent: the cat (performer of the action &quot;eat&quot;)

And sometimes, the agent is implied, as in : The mouse is eaten.

1st interpretation: 

It&#039;s the same thing in this sentence:  クレープが食べたい。 if we consider たべたい as a verb, equivalent to the passive counterpart of &quot;desire to eat&quot;, (which does not exist in English, but if it existed it could have been something like &quot;be desired to eat&quot; ). 
Subject: クレープ   Implied agent: わたし

But actually, it&#039;s not totally a verb although it retains the ability to have direct objects, indirect object, adverbs... It&#039;s a compound i-adjective, containing the stem of a verb. It&#039;s the auxiliary i-adjective たい  used with the stem たべ.
Actually, tabetai is a japanese adjective pretty hard to translate as an English adjective, meaning something like &quot;in the state such as I desire to eat (it)&quot;. 

Yet, you are right when you say クレープ is the direct object of tabetai! But the direct object &quot;クレープを&quot; is hidden by ellipsis, because of the subject &quot;クレープが&quot;
Without ellipsis, it would have been very unnatural: 
クレープがクレープを食べたい。
as the English sentence: 
&quot;This pancake is in the state such as I desire to eat this pancake&quot; 
In English, the ellipsis consists about replacing &quot;this pancake&quot; with &quot;it&quot;. In Japanese, the ellipsis does not consist about replacing クレープを with これを, it consists about deleting it simply)]]></description>
