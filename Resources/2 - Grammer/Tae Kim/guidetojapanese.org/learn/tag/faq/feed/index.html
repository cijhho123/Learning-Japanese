<p>One of my biggest pet peeves in the field of Japanese as a second language is the 「が」 particle being called the &#8220;subject particle&#8221;. This misleading terminology comes from my second biggest pet peeve, which is educators trying to artificially tie Japanese into English language concepts. I think one of the problems is that Japanese teachers, especially native speakers, really don&#8217;t understand their own language from a conceptual point-of-view and more importantly how it logically differs from English.</p>
<p>I can illustrate how <i>stupid</i> it is to call 「が」 the subject particle in the following simple dialogue.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Ａさん： 原宿に行こうよ。<br />
Ｂさん： なんで？<br />
Ａさん：　<em>クレープが</em>食べたいから。</p></blockquote>
<p>Looking at the last sentence, if 「クレープが」 is indeed marking crepe as the subject, we can only assume that Ａさん wants to go to Harajuku because the crepe wants to eat. But that doesn&#8217;t make any sense! In reality, 「クレープ」 here is supposed to be the object of the sentence, the subject being Ａさん, who wants to eat crepe.</p>
<p>The most simple conclusion, if you insist on thinking in English, is that the 「が」 particle can either represent the subject or the object of the sentence. But why would you use the same particle to represent something completely so different as the subject and the object? And to make things even worse, consider the following dialogue.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Ａさん：何か食べようよ。<br />
Ｂさん：クレープはどう？<br />
Ａさん：<em>クレープは</em>あまり食べたくないな。</p></blockquote>
<p>If you throw in the fact that the 「は」 can also be the subject OR the object, it&#8217;s no wonder that Japanese particles seem so confusing! It&#8217;s natural that students can never figure out the difference between 「は」 and 「が」 because it seems that either can be used to indicate the same things in English. This is where Japanese teachers should really beat into their heads that the concepts they&#8217;re looking for such as the subject <i>does not exist</i> in Japanese.</p>
<p>The subject traditionally indicates who or what is doing the verb in the sentence but 「は」 only indicates the topic. For example, 「今日は忙しい」 doesn&#8217;t mean that &#8220;Today is busy&#8221;, it means &#8220;As for today, [I, he, she, we, they] is/are busy.&#8221; Only when we translate into English are we forced to create the subject by context. In this case, the translation might be &#8220;I&#8217;m busy today.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 「が」 particle also does not indicate the subject, it only identifies the unknown. For example, 「クレープが食べたいから。」 is identifying that it&#8217;s because crepe is the thing that he/she/we/they wants to eat. In English, the subject would be &#8220;it&#8221; as in, &#8220;<u>It&#8217;s</u> because I want to eat crepe&#8221;. But because Japanese doesn&#8217;t even have a subject, there is no need for such a construction.</p>
<p>This is why I&#8217;ve been calling the 「が」 particle the &#8220;identifier particle&#8221; for the longest time, and you should too because that&#8217;s what it does. There is no such thing as a subject in Japanese so it makes no sense to have a &#8220;subject&#8221; particle. (Please feel free to do the double quote sign while saying &#8220;subject&#8221; in &#8220;subject particle&#8221;.)</p>
<p>For further reading, I highly suggest this blog post: 「<a href="http://lib21.blog96.fc2.com/blog-entry-665.html">日本語に主語はあるのか？</a>」.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Originally published: 2005/2/5</p></blockquote>
<p>Since this is my first post, I figured I would start from the very basics.  While the word &#8220;basic&#8221; has a connotation of meaning &#8220;easy&#8221; (eg Visual Basic), this is not the case for Japanese. The most basic ideas in Japanese are the hardest to grasp because the fundamental differences between English and Japanese leaves out any way to actually express the idea in English. Unless you speak a similar language like Korean *eh hem*, you&#8217;re going to have to wrestle with a concept that doesn&#8217;t even exist in your native language. One such example is the idea of particles and especially the particles 「は」 and 「が」.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s the difference between 「は」 and 「が」?</h2>
<p>I wish I had a nickel for every time I heard the question, &#8220;What is the difference between the 「は」 and 「が」 particle?&#8221; This question has successfully managed to baffle countless generations of people learning Japanese.  This has been followed by countless number of <a href="http://japanese.about.com/library/weekly/aa051301a.htm">equally confusing (and sometimes wrong) explanations</a> involving a great deal of mumbo-jumbo such as contrast, emphasis, subordinate clauses, and voodoo magic. However, with my genius, I was able to provide a complete explanation in one small sentence.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>「は」 and 「が」 have different meanings.</b></p></blockquote>
<p>I think the more appropriate question would be, &#8220;What <b>isn&#8217;t</b> different about 「は」 and 「が」?&#8221; You may be thinking, &#8220;But in English, they both identify the subject of the sentence.&#8221; Ahh, English. Isn&#8217;t English that language that can&#8217;t even express the very concept of 「は」 and 「が」? Well, no wonder it looks the same in <b>that</b> language. That&#8217;s like a red-green color-blind person holding a red and green sheet of paper and saying, &#8220;Hey, isn&#8217;t this the same color?&#8221;</p>
<h2>Japanese: A language of context</h2>
<p>Since 「は」 and 「が」 mean totally different things, the only thing we need to do in order to identify their differences is to fully understand what they actually mean and why they exist. The first thing we need to realize is that a Japanese sentence is not required to have a subject. You can just say, &#8220;Hit ball&#8221; and you&#8217;re good to go.  So how do you know what the heck everybody is talking about?</p>
<p>Well, there are several ways and they all involve making assumptions from context.  For example, if I suddenly asked you, &#8220;Ate lunch?&#8221; you assume I&#8217;m asking if <b>you</b> ate lunch because I&#8217;m surely not talking about anyone else. Therefore, you answer, &#8220;Ate lunch.&#8221; Then I assume you are talking about yourself since I just asked you the question and so I now know that you ate lunch. However, if we happened to be talking about Alice when I asked you the question, you will likely assume that I&#8217;m asking if Alice ate lunch because that&#8217;s who we were talking about.</p>
<h2>Ok, so what does 「は」 mean?</h2>
<p>If we take a language like Japanese where the subject is so heavily based on context, we need to be able to identify a couple things. While making assumptions from context will work for simple question and answer sessions, anything more complicated will soon become a mess as everybody starts to lose track of who or what they&#8217;re talking about. Therefore, we need to be able to tell the listener when we want to change the current topic to say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m going to talk about <b>this</b> now. So don&#8217;t assume I&#8217;m still talking about the old thing.&#8221; This is especially important when you strike up a new conversation and you need to tell the listener what you&#8217;re talking about. This is what the 「は」 particle does; it introduces a different topic from the current one. For that reason, it is also referred to as the &#8216;topic particle&#8217;.</p>
<p>Lets take the previous example where I wanted to ask you if you ate. The conversation might look like the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Me) <span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べた</span>？ &#8211; Did <em>you</em> eat?<br />
You) <span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べた</span>。 &#8211; I ate.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, what if I wanted to ask you if Alice ate? Then I need to use the 「は」 particle to indicate that I&#8217;m talking about Alice. Otherwise, you would just assume I&#8217;m talking about you.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Me) アリス<em>は</em><span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べた</span>？ &#8211; Did <em>Alice</em> eat?<br />
You) <span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べた</span>。 &#8211; She ate.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice how once I establish Alice as the new topic, we can continue to assume that we are talking about her until someone changes the topic.</p>
<h2>So what does 「が」 mean then?</h2>
<p>Ok, so we can introduce a new topic using the 「は」 particle. But what if we don&#8217;t know what the topic is? What if I wanted to ask, &#8220;Who ate the chicken?&#8221; What I need is some kind of <i>identifier</i> because I don&#8217;t know who ate the chicken. If I used the 「は」 particle, the question would become, &#8220;Did who eat the chicken?&#8221; and that doesn&#8217;t make any sense because &#8220;who&#8221; is not an actual person.</p>
<p>This is where the 「が」 particle comes into play. It is also referred to as the subject particle but I hate that name since it means something completely different in English grammar. Instead, I move to call it the <i>identifier</i> particle because it identifies something unknown.</p>
<p>The conversation about the chicken-eater culprit might go something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Me) <span title="だれ- who" class="popup">誰</span><em>が</em><span title="チキン - chicken" class="popup">チキン</span>を<span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べた</span>？ &#8211; Who ate the chicken?<br />
You) アリス<em>が</em><span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べた</span>。 &#8211; Alice [is the one who] ate it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice that the 「が」 particle is used twice because you need to identify who ate the chicken in the answer. You can&#8217;t say 「アリス<em>は</em><span title="たべる - to eat" class="popup">食べた</span>。」 because we&#8217;re not talking about Alice. We&#8217;re trying to identify the unknown person that ate the chicken.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now, that I&#8217;ve clearly explained what 「は」 and 「が」 means, I hope this will finally clear up that question that has been haunting your mind. Remember, if you are talking about something new, use 「は」. If you are trying to identify something unknown, use 「が」. Simple, huh?</p>
