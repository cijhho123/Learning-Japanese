Have you even read the article past the headline? The author isn&#039;t calling &quot;learning kanji&quot; useless. They&#039;re just saying that the expression &quot;learn kanji&quot; itself is just laughable, because of how much there is to kanji. They even state in the conclusion that you should indeed &quot;learn kanji&quot; along with learning words. Seriously, actually read the article next time before going on a whole rant like this. You will save yourself some time.]]></description>

Very much this. The whole idea that you need to &#039;learn the reading of a kanji in order to use it&#039; is baloney. We know this, because go ask a Japanese person if they sometimes have trouble remembering how to write a kanji. Of course they do! Doesn&#039;t mean they don&#039;t know what the word means.]]></description>

That depends entirely on the word being spoken.  Don&#039;t focus on all the different possible readings of a Kanji.  You&#039;ll never remember them without proper context.  Focus on learning each new Kanji and reading in the direct context of the word or sentence you&#039;re learning.  That will make learning easier, more practical, and more efficient.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry but I don&#039;t particularly agree with your article here. I would put learning Kanji as a strong priority in learning Japanese, even if it isn&#039;t easy or quick. Furthermore, I feel very confident in the method of learning kanji by keyword (i.e. Heisig&#039;s Remember the Kanji) with full knowledge that one keyword is not exhaustive of the meaning for most Kanji. The keyword will be indispensable however in making a mnemonic story to stick the Kanji to memory.

There is literally a book, plus a community website (Kanji Koohii), plus ready made Anki decks for the purpose of learning the Kanji this way, so the path is laid out.

Once you have learned the Kanji, and even as you are progressing through the list, written media will become infinitely less intimidating to look upon, and as you read you can pick up vocabulary and then learn the practical use and readings of Kanji. Surprisingly, this is the much easier step as for reasons beyond my understanding the readings associated with Kanji just seem to stick to memory without great effort. Of course, it follows that once you know which Kanji make up vocabulary, that vocabulary in turn becomes much easier to remember.

While writing the Kanji may not have too much practical use these days, reading it certainly does. I understand that the author has good intentions in saving people time, but having walked the path myself I would recommend going against their advice. Please do put time and effort into &#039;learning the Kanji&#039; as it will set you up for learning how to read it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with most of what you say, except your aversion to the phrase &quot;learning the kanji&quot;. The kanji are a writing system, not a fundamental part of the Japanese language and it should be treated as such.

Naturally, kanji and the Latin alphabet can&#039;t be compared in all respects (one being an alphabet, the other being a logography), but they can be compared to the extent that they can be known in two different ways: as isolated symbols and within words.

Being a native speaker of German I grew up expecting a very high correspondence between letters and sounds (it&#039;s not perfect, but it&#039;s fairly good). Later, learning English, knowing how every letter is pronounced wasn&#039;t overly helpful when it comes to reading and writing, but I wouldn&#039;t say that &quot;I don&#039;t know the letter &#039;g&#039; before knowing how to use it in the word &#039;though&#039;&quot;, for example. Learning a writing system and learning how to write is a difference, at least to me.

Now since the kanji are a logography, it makes most sense to think of the symbols as carriers of meaning, not of sound. Hence, I consider a kanji as learned, when I can connect it to a concept. At the time of writing, I have learned about 1000 kanji. That doesn&#039;t mean that I can read, just like knowing the alphabet doesn&#039;t mean that on can read, but it&#039;s easier to learn reading when you know your symbols.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s completely stupid to say that it&#039;s futile to learn readings.I&#039;ve memorized over 2000+ kanjis onyomi readings.Why?Because I want to be able to look it up on the dictionary.In order for me to search a word on dictionary,I need to be able to &quot;write&quot; it with my keyboard.In order to do that,I need to &quot;write&quot; the reading of that word.Not all words are read as  onyomi+onyomi but a huge amount of them are.

I classified words into  3 categories.
1st group: Kanji + kana combination words
2nd group: Kana words
3rd group: Kanji+kanji words

3rd group is divided into 3 groups:
a-Onyomi+onyomi words,, i.e. when kanjis come together,their onyomi readings are used to read them
b-Onyomi+onyomi,there are some words whose onyomi readings are used for their reading,but their readings are abbreviated,like 結果 
c-Kunyomi+Kunyomi,same as above,except kunyomi reading is used 
d-kunyomi+onyomi or vice versa,self explanatory,I dont need to  explain what this is

So,in order to read most of these 3rd group words,you &quot;have to&quot; know how kanjis are read.So,I don&#039;t agree with you.One should learn the onyomi readings at least.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/you-cant-learn-kanji/#comment-1624&quot;&gt;サナテイ&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;re asking about describing kanji or simply speaking Japanese. I&#039;ll answer the former first. It depends, unfortunately. Because Japanese phonics are so limited, picking one pronunciation isn&#039;t enough to convey what kanji you&#039;re using. You have to tell them the word you&#039;re using and then point to the kanji in that word. For example, if you&#039;re referring to one kanji for the word test (試験 しけん), then you need to say &quot;しけんのけん&quot; if that&#039;s the kanji you&#039;re trying to describe to people. 

The second is well, even harder. From what I understand so far after a couple of years is that kanji normally takes on the onyomi form when paired with other kanji, and kunyomi when attached to hiragana. For example, the 食 kanji&#039;s onyomi is しょく, and the kunyomi is た(べ). Eat is 食べる, food is 食べ物 (たべもの), but meal is 食事 (しょくじ), also turning the kanji reading for こと (kunyomi) into じ (onyomi). It&#039;s really frustrating but over time you memorize words and know which one means what. I suggest that when you learn a kanji you take some time to learn vocabulary that uses it to get a handle on how both pronunciations are used.]]></description>
