This idea of &quot;marked&quot; seems to be some artifact of romance language linguistics. There is no special decision to put cake in front or not. That whole type of thinking is foreign and unnatural to Japanese. You can probably make it work but it&#039;s forced and artificial. Topic sets context so due to the nature of its purpose, it&#039;s more common to start with it. However, is ケーキを俺が食べた marked? Who knows? The conclusion of the thought comes at the end so regardless of what particles are used, emphasis tends to increase toward the end. That is far closer to how the actual language works than this forced concept or marked vs unmarked.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Word order does not necessarily refer to what is syntactically correct, but also to what is marked.

English is an SVO language but that does not mean you can&#039;t form sentences a different way:
I ate the cake. (SVO. An unmarked sentence.)
The cake I ate. (But your biscuits I ate not, so stop your accusations. OSV and thus marked.)
Changing the word order makes clear to the listener that you made a conscious decision to put the cake in the front and this conveys information.

俺はケーキを食べた。- SOV. From what I know of Japanese, this is an unmarked sentence.
ケーキを俺は食べた。-  If Japanese is indeed an SOV language, this word order makes speakers understand that you made a special decision to put cake to the front and the topic closer to the verb.
Is that so? If yes, people just need to be taught the difference between word order in the sense of syntactical restraints (any verb final sentence is correct) and word order in the sense of marking (anything not SOV is marked).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this explanation. Noticing that the particles give away the function of the word already, I&#039;ve asked myself during my studies why the ostensibly strict word order had to be there. That question arose from the fact that my native language, which is usually classified as an SOV language, can also change its word order as it pleases because the forms of the words already give away their functions in the sentence. I am glad I was right in my assumption that Japanese had a lot freer word order than we are taught in college.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love your explanations; they make such sense and seem to get at the heart of Japanese. One comment: I believe that when you say &quot;relative clause&quot; in this post, you mean just &quot;clause.&quot; In general (not speaking of Japanese in particular) a &quot;clause&quot; is a verb and its associated information. A clause becomes a relative clause when it is used to modify something —like, This is the girl *who came yesterday.&quot; So &quot;this is the girl&quot; is the main clause, and the rest is the relative clause.]]></description>
