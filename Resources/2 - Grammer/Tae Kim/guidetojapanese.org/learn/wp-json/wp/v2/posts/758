The word I&#8217;m going to talk about uses a completely different Kanji from \u300c\u6575\u300d meaning &#8220;enemy&#8221;  and is in fact a very useful and helpful ally.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve studied Japanese for a while, you&#8217;re bound to have encountered the \u300c\u7684\u300d kanji. While this kanji by itself is read as \u300c\u307e\u3068\u300d and means a &#8220;target&#8221;, its usefulness really shines as a noun suffix. This kanji can be attached to countless nouns to easily change them to a <a href=\"https:\/\/guidetojapanese.org\/learn\/complete\/adjectives\">na-adjective<\/a>.  In this case, you read the kanji as \u300c\u3066\u304d\u300d and you&#8217;ll see it all over the place: \u4e00\u822c\u7684\u3001\u5727\u5012\u7684\u3001\u611f\u52d5\u7684\u3001\u7fd2\u6163\u7684\u3001\u6280\u8853\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u3001and on and on.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take the word \u300c\u611f\u52d5\u300d meaning &#8220;deep emotion&#8221; and say we want to say the following sentence.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>That movie was very moving.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, since \u300c\u611f\u52d5\u300d is a noun, we can&#8217;t just say, \u300c\u3042\u306e\u6620\u753b\u306f\u3068\u3066\u3082\u611f\u52d5\u300d because the movie is not a deep emotion. So you&#8217;re going to have to say something complicated like the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p> \u3042\u306e\u6620\u753b\u3092\u898b\u3066\u3001\u611f\u52d5\u3057\u305f\u3002<br \/>\nI saw that movie and I was moved.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>But wait! We can just use \u300c\u7684\u300d to make \u300c\u611f\u52d5\u300d into an adjective!<\/p>\n<blockquote><p> \u3042\u306e\u6620\u753b\u306f<em>\u611f\u52d5\u7684<\/em>\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002<br \/>\nThat movie was very moving.<\/p>\n<p>\u3042\u308c\u306f<em>\u611f\u52d5\u7684\u306a<\/em>\u6620\u753b\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002<br \/>\nThat was a very moving movie.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>What could be argued as even more useful is if you use the <a href=\"https:\/\/guidetojapanese.org\/learn\/complete\/verb_particles#_Target_Particle\">\u300c\u306b\u300d target particle<\/a> with \u300c\u7684\u300d, you can make the noun into an adverb!  (Actually, this applies to <a href=\"https:\/\/guidetojapanese.org\/learn\/complete\/adverbs\">all na-adjectives<\/a>)<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u305d\u308c\u306f\u6280\u8853\u7684<em>\u306b<\/em>\u7121\u7406\u3067\u3059\u3002<br \/>\nThat&#8217;s technically impossible.<\/p>\n<p>\u671d\u3054\u98ef\u306f\u7fd2\u6163\u7684<em>\u306b<\/em>\u6bce\u671d\u98df\u3079\u307e\u3059\u3002<br \/>\nI customarily eat breakfast every morning.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In fact, without \u300c\u7684\u300d there are just so many things that can&#8217;t be expressed. I would definitely put this kanji on my top 100 list.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u3067\u306f\u3001\u8eca\u3067\u901a\u52e4\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304c<em>\u4e00\u822c\u7684<\/em>\u3060\u3002<br \/>\nIn America, people generally commute by car.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u5ba2\u89b3\u7684\u306a<\/em>\u8996\u70b9\u304b\u3089\u8003\u3048\u305f\u307b\u3046\u304c\u3044\u3044\u3002<br \/>\nIt&#8217;s better to think of it from a objective viewpoint.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Originally Published: 2005\/2\/6 While the word \u300c\u3066\u304d\u300d usually means &#8220;enemy&#8221;, that&#8217;s not the word we&#8217;re talking about today.
