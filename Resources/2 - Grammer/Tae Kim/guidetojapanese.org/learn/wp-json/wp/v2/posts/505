In teaching, it&#8217;s convenient to group similar concepts and cover them together. However, when it comes time to use them in practice, it can create confusion as learners try to decide which grammar to use and get caught up in trying to find the difference between similar concepts.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at some examples and why one grammar is more appropriate over others in various situations. It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that there is often no one right answer as it really depends on what you want to say exactly.<\/p>\n<h3>Like, it&#8217;s not like I like it like that<\/h3>\n<p>&#8220;Like&#8221; is a word in English that has many usages and can even be overused. With words like this, it&#8217;s natural that other languages have many different types of grammar that all translate to the same word in English. Therefore, we need to learn to make distinctions that we usually don&#8217;t think about.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is it an impression of the future or guess (with some uncertainty)?
