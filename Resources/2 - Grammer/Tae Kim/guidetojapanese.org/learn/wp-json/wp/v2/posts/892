However, in Japanese, the order must be subject, object, then verb.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Myth<\/b><br \/>\nEnglish sentence order = [Subject] [Verb] [Object]<br \/>\nJapanese sentence order = [Subject] [Object] [Verb] <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I can debunk this myth is 2 seconds. Let&#8217;s see, is this sentence correct?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\uff11\uff09<span title=\"\u308a\u3093\u3054- apple\" class=\"popup\">\u6797\u6a8e<\/span>\u3092<span title=\"\u308f\u305f\u3057 - me, myself, I\" class=\"popup\">\u79c1<\/span>\u304c<span title=\"\u305f\u3079\u308b - to eat\" class=\"popup\">\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3002<\/span><br \/> -Apple I ate.\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Why, yes it is. And look, the object appears to come before the subject. Boy, that was easy.<\/p>\n<p>There are several misleading things about this myth besides the fact that it&#8217;s just plain incorrect. First of all, as I&#8217;ve partially explained in a <a href=\"https:\/\/guidetojapanese.org\/learn\/difference-between-wa-and-ga\/\">previous post<\/a>, Japanese doesn&#8217;t require or even have anything equivalent to the English subject. In addition, you only need a verb to make a complete thought in Japanese.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\uff11\uff09<span title=\"\u305f\u3079\u308b - to eat\" class=\"popup\">\u98df\u3079\u305f<\/span>\u3002<br \/> -Ate.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>What gets tricky is that the state-of-being verb (the English verb &#8220;to be&#8221;) can be implicitly implied by a noun or adjective. That&#8217;s because Japanese doesn&#8217;t have an actual verb for the state-of-being.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\uff11\uff09<span title=\"\u305d\u308c- that\" class=\"popup\">\u305d\u308c<\/span>\u306f<span title=\"\u3056\u3093\u306d\u3093 - unfortunate\" class=\"popup\">\u6b8b\u5ff5<\/span>\u3002<br \/> -That [is] unfortunate.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Why Japanese doesn&#8217;t have strict sentence order<\/h2>\n<p>In Japanese, we have things called particles that come after almost every word in the sentence to identify exactly what role that word is playing. That means that no matter where the word is in the sentence, we&#8217;ll know whether it&#8217;s an object, topic, identifier, target, context, etc.. The only reason sentence order is so strict in English is because without clear rules of ordering, we won&#8217;t have any idea which word is supposed to play which role.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In English, sentence order changes the meaning of the sentence.<br \/>\n\uff11\uff09 Dog saw Tree.<br \/>\n\uff12\uff09Tree saw Dog.<\/p>\n<p>In Japanese, because of particles, no matter how you move things around, the dog is still the topic and the tree is still the object.<br \/>\n\uff11\uff09 Dog[topic particle]  tree[object particle]  saw. = Dog saw tree.<br \/>\n\uff12\uff09 Tree[object particle]  dog[topic particle]  saw. = Dog saw tree.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Clauses<\/h2>\n<p>In order to really understand Japanese sentence structure, you need to break things down into clauses. A clause is the smallest part of a sentence that expresses a complete thought. As mentioned previously, in order to express a complete thought, you must have a verb or a noun\/adjective that is a state-of-being.  Now, the only thing you have to remember is that everything that applies to that verb must come before it. And that each clause can have only one such verb.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The verb (or state-of-being) must come at the very <u>end<\/u> of the clause<\/p>\n<p>\uff11\uff09<span title=\"\u3044\u306c - dog\" class=\"popup\">\u72ac<\/span>\u304c<span title=\"\u304d - tree\" class=\"popup\">\u6728<\/span>\u3092<u><span title=\"\u307f\u308b - to see\" class=\"popup\">\u898b\u305f<\/span><\/u>\u3002 &#8211; The dog saw tree.<br \/>\n\uff12\uff09<span title=\"\u304d - tree\" class=\"popup\">\u6728<\/span>\u3092<span title=\"\u3044\u306c - dog\" class=\"popup\">\u72ac<\/span>\u304c<u><span title=\"\u307f\u308b - to see\" class=\"popup\">\u898b\u305f<\/span><\/u>\u3002 &#8211; The dog saw tree.<\/p>\n<p>\uff11\uff09<span title=\"\u308f\u305f\u3057 - me, myself, I\" class=\"popup\">\u79c1<\/span>\u306f<u><span title=\"\u304c\u304f\u305b\u3044 - student\" class=\"popup\">\u5b66\u751f<\/span>\u3067\u3059<\/u>\u3002 &#8211; I am student.<br \/>\n\uff12\uff09<span title=\"\u304c\u304f\u305b\u3044 - student\" class=\"popup\">\u5b66\u751f<\/span>\u306f<u><span title=\"\u308f\u305f\u3057 - me, myself, I\" class=\"popup\">\u79c1<\/span>\u3067\u3059<\/u>\u3002 &#8211; The student is me.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>That&#8217;s it!<\/h2>\n<p>Surprisingly, that&#8217;s really the only thing you have to worry about in terms of Japanese sentence ordering. It&#8217;s one of the great benefits of particles actually because sentence order no longer defines a word&#8217;s function.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>All of the following sentences are correct.<br \/>\n\uff11\uff09<span title=\"\u304b\u308c - he; boyfriend\" class=\"popup\">\u5f7c<\/span>\u306f<span title=\"\u3044\u3064\u3082 - always\" class=\"popup\">\u3044\u3064\u3082<\/span><span title=\"\u3068\u3057\u3087\u304b\u3093 - library\" class=\"popup\">\u56f3\u66f8\u9928<\/span>\u3067<u><span title=\"\u3079\u3093\u304d\u3087\u3046 - study\" class=\"popup\">\u52c9\u5f37<\/span><span title=\"\u3059\u308b - to do\" class=\"popup\">\u3059\u308b<\/span><\/u>\u3002<br \/>\n\uff12\uff09<span title=\"\u3044\u3064\u3082 - always\" class=\"popup\">\u3044\u3064\u3082<\/span><span title=\"\u3068\u3057\u3087\u304b\u3093 - library\" class=\"popup\">\u56f3\u66f8\u9928<\/span>\u3067<span title=\"\u304b\u308c - he; boyfriend\" class=\"popup\">\u5f7c<\/span>\u306f<u><span title=\"\u3079\u3093\u304d\u3087\u3046 - study\" class=\"popup\">\u52c9\u5f37<\/span><span title=\"\u3059\u308b - to do\" class=\"popup\">\u3059\u308b<\/span><\/u>\u3002<br \/>\n\uff13\uff09<span title=\"\u3068\u3057\u3087\u304b\u3093 - library\" class=\"popup\">\u56f3\u66f8\u9928<\/span>\u3067<span title=\"\u304b\u308c - he; boyfriend\" class=\"popup\">\u5f7c<\/span>\u306f<span title=\"\u3044\u3064\u3082 - always\" class=\"popup\">\u3044\u3064\u3082<\/span><u><span title=\"\u3079\u3093\u304d\u3087\u3046 - study\" class=\"popup\">\u52c9\u5f37<\/span><span title=\"\u3059\u308b - to do\" class=\"popup\">\u3059\u308b<\/span><\/u>\u3002<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It is also important to realize that the farther away you get from the main verb, the more extraneous the information becomes.

But as long as the sentence structure in each separate clause is correct, there should be no problems with sentence ordering no matter how complicated and long the sentence is.<\/p>\n<h2>Addendum<\/h2>\n<p>(added 2017\/10\/19)<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure linguistic experts will claim I&#8217;m totally wrong and SOV is a classification, word order preference, or whatever you want to call it and doesn&#8217;t technically require an &#8220;S&#8221; or &#8220;O&#8221;. My original point in the article (though admittedly I was younger and more dramatic) is that this classification doesn&#8217;t help SLA and in fact creates a lot of confusion and common mistakes for beginners learning Japanese as a second language.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a BIG stretch to say there&#8217;s some equivalence to English as an SVO language. In English, saying &#8220;Ball boy hits&#8221; is grammatically incorrect. On the other hand, in Japanese, not only are both &#8220;Ball boy hits&#8221; and &#8220;Boy ball hits&#8221; grammatically correct, they <i>have the same meaning<\/i> if the particles remain unchanged regardless of order. There&#8217;s a fundamental difference in the two languages that is not accurately portrayed by this misleading classification.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, I believe the whole viewpoint of SOV vs SVO linguistically is very western-centric and not a good way to describe Japanese. If you want to prove me wrong with a mathematical proof in the style of formal language theory, that&#8217;s one thing but this is far more subjective and to say one is &#8220;wrong&#8221; because it doesn&#8217;t adhere to an established curriculum is short-sighted. I highly doubt linguistics created in a vacuum purely for Japanese would have taken the same approach here.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Originally Published: 2005\/2\/16 I&#8217;ve mentioned this before, but I&#8217;d like to repeat myself here to hopefully help the debunking of the age-old Japanese sentence order myth.
