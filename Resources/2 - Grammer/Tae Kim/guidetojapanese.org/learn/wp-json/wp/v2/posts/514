For example, &#8220;I received a present from John&#8221; means practically the same thing as &#8220;John gave me a present&#8221; The same applies for Japanese as shown in the examples below.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u30d7\u30ec\u30bc\u30f3\u30c8\u3092<em>\u3082\u3089\u3063\u305f<\/em>\u3002<br \/>\n(I) received present from John.<\/li>\n<li>\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u30d7\u30ec\u30bc\u30f3\u30c8\u3092<em>\u304f\u308c\u305f<\/em>\u3002<br \/>\nJohn gave (me) present.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Translated to English, both sentences essentially mean &#8220;John bought present for me&#8221;. While the viewpoint is reversed, essentially they are saying the same thing.<\/p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t have to worry about which word to use for receiving because there is only one. So let&#8217;s look at how to decide which word to use for giving.<\/p>\n<h3>Giving from the speaker&#8217;s point of view<\/h3>\n<p>The easiest and most common scenario is when you, yourself is the one giving or receiving. As previously mentioned, because the speaker is always at the bottom, he\/she will always use \u300c\u3042\u3052\u308b\u300d to give to others and \u300c\u304f\u308c\u308b\u300d when others give to the speaker.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\u79c1\u306b<em>\u304f\u308c\u308b<\/em>\u306e\uff1f<br \/>\nAre (you) giving (it) to me?<\/li>\n<li>\u79c1\u304c<em>\u3042\u3052\u308b<\/em>\u306e\uff1f<br \/>\nI&#8217;m giving (it) to you?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Using the same logic, it&#8217;s safe to say the following will always be <b>incorrect<\/b> regardless of the social status of the other person.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\u79c1\u306b<em><strike>\u3042\u3052\u308b<\/strike><\/em>\u306e\uff1f<\/li>\n<li>\u79c1\u304c<em><strike>\u304f\u308c\u308b<\/strike><\/em>\u306e\uff1f<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Giving from 3rd person&#8217;s point of view<\/h3>\n<p>The only scenario left is when both the giver and receiver is different from the speaker.

Basically, the speaker must choose which viewpoint he\/she wants to look at the situation from.<\/p>\n<p>For example, let&#8217;s say you wanted to know if \uff21\u3055\u3093 gave \uff22\u3055\u3093 a present. If you were asking \uff21\u3055\u3093, you would use \u300c\u3042\u3052\u308b\u300d because you are looking at it from \uff21\u3055\u3093&#8217;s perspective as the giver.<\/p>\n<p>\uff21\u3055\u3093\u306f\u3001\uff22\u3055\u3093\u306b\u30d7\u30ec\u30bc\u30f3\u30c8\u3092<em>\u3042\u3052\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304b<\/em>\uff1f \uff08Asking \uff21\u3055\u3093\uff09<\/p>\n<p>If you were asking \uff22\u3055\u3093, you would use \u300c\u304f\u308c\u308b\u300d because you are looking at it from \uff22\u3055\u3093&#8217;s perspective as the receiver.<\/p>\n<p>\uff21\u3055\u3093\u306f\u3001\uff22\u3055\u3093\u306b\u30d7\u30ec\u30bc\u30f3\u30c8\u3092<em>\u304f\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304b<\/em>\uff1f \uff08Asking \uff22\u3055\u3093\uff09<\/p>\n<p>In summary, deciding which word to use in this scenario can be described in two steps.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick a perspective either as the giver or receiver<\/li>\n<li>Use \u300c\u3042\u3052\u308b\u300d if from giver&#8217;s perspective or \u300c\u304f\u308c\u308b\u300d if from receiver&#8217;s perspective (same as if you were the giver)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Giving and receiving whether it&#8217;s objects or favors is a bit more complicated in Japanese because you need to be aware of the social status between the giver and the receiver.
