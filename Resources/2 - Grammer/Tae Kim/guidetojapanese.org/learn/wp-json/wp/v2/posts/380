In addition, we also learned numbers up to 99 and how to count a person&#8217;s age. Let&#8217;s apply what we learned to come up with a simple self-introduction. The best way to learn a language is to regularly interact in that language and the only way to do that is to meet Japanese speakers so a self-introduction is an ideal way to practice.<\/p>\n<h2>Learning the expressions<\/h2>\n<p>You only need a couple of fixed expressions for your simple self-introduction.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\u306f\u3058\u3081\u307e\u3057\u3066<br \/>\nShortened form of an expression originally meaning &#8220;I meet you for the first time&#8221;.

As we&#8217;ve learned, Japanese has a relatively limited set of sounds so it&#8217;s very likely that your name will need to sound very different from its native pronunciation.<\/p>\n<p>I would recommend asking your teacher or a Japanese speaker for help in converting your name to the Katakana equivalent. You may even want to ask the first person you introduce yourself to.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to give it a try on your own (like right now), you can try this tutorial on finding your name in Japanese: https:\/\/guidetojapanese.org\/learn\/resources\/nameinjapanese<\/p>\n<p>To say you are that name, you need only attach \u300c\u3067\u3059\u300d to the name. The pronunciation is usually shortened to just &#8220;dess&#8221;. We will learn more about \u300c\u3067\u3059\u300d in the next chapter. <\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"toggleSpoilers(); return false;\">Toggle Translations<\/a><\/p>\n<p>[name]\u3067\u3059\u3002<br \/>\n(I am) [name].<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n\u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u3067\u3059\u3002<br \/>\n<span class=\"spoiler\">(I am) Brown.<\/span>\n<\/li>\n<li>\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9\u30fb\u30b9\u30df\u30b9\u3067\u3059\u3002<br \/>\n<span class=\"spoiler\">(I am) Alice Smith.<\/span>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>In Japan, the last name is given more weight so it is common to just go by your last name especially in a more formal environment such as the classroom or workplace. When using the full name, the last name always comes first for Japanese names.
