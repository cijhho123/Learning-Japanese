However, even though we have already covered all the casual forms, truly mastering casual speech in Japanese requires far more than just learning the various casual forms. There are countless numbers of ways in which wordings and pronunciations change as well as differences between male and female speech. Understanding slang also requires knowing various vocabulary that is also growing with every new generation. Many adults would be hard-pressed to understand the kind of slang being used by kids today.<\/p>\n<p>While comprehensively covering slang and relevant vocabulary would require a book in and of itself (a book that would soon become out of date), I&#8217;ll instead cover some broad patterns and common phenomenon which will at least help you get started in understanding the most common aspects of Japanese slang. There is no particular order in the material presented here and I expect this page to grow continuously as I find different things to cover.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that slang is also heavily influenced by local dialects. Although all the material presented here is valid for the greater Tokyo area, your mileage may vary depending on where you are located.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"part2\">Basic Principles of Slang<\/h2>\n<p>In the world of slang, anything goes and rules that apply to written Japanese are often broken. The most difficult part is that, of course, you can&#8217;t just say whatever you want. When you break the rules, you have to break it the correct way. Taking what you learned from textbooks or Japanese classes and applying it to the real world is not so easy because it is impossible to teach all the possible ways things can get jumbled up in the spoken language. Learning how to speak naturally with all the correct idiosyncrasies and inconsistencies in a language is something that requires practice with real people in real-world situations. In this section, we&#8217;ll look at some common patterns and themes that will at least help you get an idea of where the majority of slang originates from.<\/p>\n<p>One thing you&#8217;ll soon realize when you first start talking to Japanese people in real life is that many sounds are slurred together. This is especially true for males. The fact is voices in instructional material such as language tapes often exaggerate the pronunciation of each letter in order to make aural comprehension easier. In reality, not all the sounds are pronounced as clearly as it should be and things end up sounding different from how it&#8217;s written on paper.<\/p>\n<p>There is one major driving factor behind the majority of slang in Japanese. The primary goal of most slang is to make things easier to say. In other words, the goal is to reduce or simplify the movement of your mouth. There are two primary ways in which this is accomplished, 1) By making things shorter or, 2) By slurring the sounds together. We have already seen many examples of the first method such as shortening \u300c\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u300d to \u300c\u304b\u3082\u300d or preferring \u300c\u3068\u300d to the longer conditional forms. The second method makes things easier to say usually by substituting parts of words with sounds that fit better with the sounds surrounding it or by merging two or more sounds together. For example, the same \u300c\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u300d might be pronounced \u300c\u304b\u3082\u3057\u3093\u306a\u3044\u300d since \u300c\u3057\u3093\u300d requires less movement than \u300c\u3057\u308c\u300d.<\/p>\n<div class=\"note\"><b>The fundamental goal of slang is to reduce mouth movement<\/b><\/div>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see some more examples of words that get shortened or slurred.

It&#8217;s very natural because it&#8217;s guided by how your mouth moves. With a fair amount of practice, you should be able to naturally pick up shorter, alternative pronunciations and incorporate them into your own speech.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"part3\">Sentence ordering and particles (or the lack thereof)<\/h2>\n<h3>Vocabulary<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\u305d\u308c &#8211; that<\/li>\n<li>\u4f55 \u3010\u306a\u306b\uff0f\u306a\u3093\u3011 &#8211; what<\/li>\n<li>\u898b\u308b \u3010\u307f\u30fb\u308b\u3011 (ru-verb) &#8211; to see<\/li>\n<li>\u3042\u306e &#8211; that (over there) \uff08abbr. of \u3042\u308c\u306e\uff09<\/li>\n<li>\u4eba \u3010\u3072\u3068\u3011 &#8211; person<\/li>\n<li>\u3082\u3046 &#8211; already<\/li>\n<li>\u98df\u3079\u308b \u3010\u305f\u3079\u30fb\u308b\u3011 (ru-verb) &#8211; to eat<\/li>\n<li>\u6628\u65e5\u3010\u304d\u306e\u3046\u3011 &#8211; yesterday<\/li>\n<li>\u8cb7\u3046 \u3010\u304b\u30fb\u3046\u3011 (u-verb) &#8211; to buy<\/li>\n<li>\u30a2\u30a4\u30b9 &#8211; ice (short for ice cream)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>While written Japanese already has fairly loose rules regarding sentence order, casual spoken Japanese takes it one step further. A complete sentence requires a verb at the end of the sentence to complete the thought. However, we&#8217;ll see how this rule is bent in casual conversations.<\/p>\n<p>Conversations are sporadic and chaotic in any language and it&#8217;s common for people to say the first thing that pops into their head without thinking out the whole proper sentence.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you wanted to ask what something was, the normal, proper way would be to ask, \u300c\u305d\u308c\u306f\u4f55\uff1f\u300d However, if the first thing that popped into your head, &#8220;What the?&#8221; then it would be more natural to say \u300c\u4f55\u300d first. However, since \u300c\u4f55\u306f\u305d\u308c\uff1f\u300d doesn&#8217;t make any sense (Is what that?), you can simply break it up into what are essentially two sentence fragments asking &#8220;what&#8221; first \uff08\u4f55\uff1f\uff09, and then following it up with the explanation of what you were talking about \uff08\u300c\u305d\u308c\u300d in this case\uff09. For the sake of convenience, this is lumped into what looks like one sentence.<\/p>\n<h3>Examples<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\u305d\u308c\u306f\u4f55\uff1f<br \/>\nWhat is that?<\/li>\n<li>\u4f55\u305d\u308c\uff1f<br \/>\nWhat? That. (Two sentences lumped into one)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Sometimes, the first thing that pops into your head might be main verb. But if the main verb has already slipped out of your mouth, you&#8217;re now left with the rest of the sentence without a verb to complete the thought. In conversational Japanese, it&#8217;s perfectly acceptable to have the verb come first using the same technique we just saw by breaking them into two sentences. The second sentence is incomplete of course, but that kind of thing is common in the speech of any language.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\u898b\u305f\uff1f \u3042\u306e\u4eba\uff1f<br \/>\nDid you see?

It is used all the time and therefore, it&#8217;s not too surprising that a number of variations and slang have developed. Here&#8217;s one more that I felt was too &#8220;slangy&#8221; to cover so early at that point of the guide.<\/p>\n<p>This may sound hard to believe but if you really slur \u300c\u3068\u3044\u3046\u300d together, it becomes something resembling \u300c\u3064\u300d. Or least, that&#8217;s what somebody thought when he or she began replacing \u300c\u3068\u3044\u3046\u300d with \u300c\u3064\u300d or in some case \u300c\u3064\u3046\u300d.<\/p>\n<p>Now, in my opinion, \u300c\u3064\u300d is a lot harder to say than \u300c\u3068\u3044\u3046\u300d so using it like a native might take a bit of practice. Rather than making things easier to say, as is usually the case, the real purpose of this substitution is to sound rougher because \u300c\u3064\u300d has a harder, hissing sound. This is ideal for when you&#8217;re pissed or for that young and rough image you&#8217;ve always wanted. As you might expect, this type of speech is usually used by males or very tough females.<\/p>\n<h3>Examples<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><em>\u3064\u3046\u304b<\/em>\u3001\u306a\u3093\u3067\u304a\u524d\u304c\u3053\u3053\u306b\u3044\u3093\u306e\u3088\uff01<br \/>\nOr rather, why are you here?!<\/li>\n<li>\u5bbf\u984c\u3067\u6642\u9593\u304c\u306a\u3044<em>\u3064\u3063\u3066<\/em>\u3093\u306e\u306b\u3001\u307f\u304d\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3068\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u306b\u3044\u3063\u305f\u3068\u805e\u3044\u305f\u3088\u3002<br \/>\nAlthough he&#8217;s saying he doesn&#8217;t have time due to homework, I heard he went on a date with Miki-chan.<\/li>\n<li>\u660e\u65e5\u306f\u8a66\u9a13\u3060\u305e\u3002<em>\u3064\u3063\u3066\u3082<\/em>\u3001\u52c9\u5f37\u306f\u3057\u3066\u306a\u3044\u3060\u308d\u3046\u306a\u3002<br \/>\nYo, tomorrow&#8217;s the test.
