In Japanese, the two are described very differently. The state-of-being we will learn is used to describe only what something is and not where it exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state-of-being is very easy to describe because it is implied within the noun or adjective. There is no need to use a verb nor even a subject to make a complete sentence in Japanese. Take for example, a casual conversation among friends asking, &#8220;How are you?&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>How are you?

We did this in our simple self-introduction in the last section and because it&#8217;s understood by context that you are talking about yourself, there is no need to add a subject.<\/p>\n<p>We can ask questions in the polite form by further adding \u300c\u304b\u300d to \u300c\u3067\u3059\u300d. The \u300c\u304b\u300d is a question marker so a question mark is not necessary.
