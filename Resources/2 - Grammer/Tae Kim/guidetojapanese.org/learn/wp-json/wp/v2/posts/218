Unfortunately, adults are expected to use a politer version of the language (called <span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u3066\u3044\u306d\u3044\u3054 - polite language\">\u4e01\u5be7\u8a9e<\/span>) when addressing certain people.

Deciding when to use which language is pretty much a matter of &#8220;feel&#8221;. However, it is a good idea to stick with one form for each person.<\/p>\n<p>Later (probably much later), we will learn an even politer version of the language called honorific \uff08<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u305d\u3093\u3051\u3044\u3054 - honorific language\">\u5c0a\u656c\u8a9e<\/span>\uff09 and humble \uff08<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u3051\u3093\u3058\u3087\u3046\u3054 - humble language\">\u8b19\u8b72\u8a9e<\/span>\uff09 form. It will be more useful than you may think because store clerks, receptionists, and such will speak to you in those forms. But for now, let&#8217;s concentrate on just <span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u3066\u3044\u306d\u3044\u3054 - polite language\">\u4e01\u5be7\u8a9e<\/span>, which is the base for <span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u305d\u3093\u3051\u3044\u3054 - honorific language\">\u5c0a\u656c\u8a9e<\/span> and <span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u3051\u3093\u3058\u3087\u3046\u3054 - humble language\">\u8b19\u8b72\u8a9e<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, it is not difficult to change casual speech to polite speech. There may be some slight changes to the vocabulary (for example, &#8220;yes&#8221; and &#8220;no&#8221; become \u300c<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u306f\u3044 - yes\">\u306f\u3044<\/span>\u300d and \u300c<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u3044\u3044\u3048 - no\">\u3044\u3044\u3048<\/span>\u300d respectively in polite speech), and very colloquial types of sentence endings are not used in polite speech. (We will learn about sentence endings in a later section.) Essentially, the only main difference between polite and casual speech comes at the very end of the sentence. You cannot even tell whether a person is speaking in polite or casual speech until the sentence is finished.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"part2\">The stem of verbs<\/h2>\n<h3>Vocabulary<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\u98df\u3079\u308b \u3010\u305f\u30fb\u3079\u308b\u3011 (ru-verb) &#8211; to eat<\/li>\n<li>\u6cf3\u3050 \u3010\u304a\u3088\u30fb\u3050\u3011 (u-verb) &#8211; to swim<\/li>\n<li>\u3059\u308b (exception) &#8211; to do<\/li>\n<li>\u6765\u308b \u3010\u304f\u30fb\u308b\u3011 (exception) &#8211; to come<\/li>\n<li>\u6012\u308b \u3010\u304a\u3053\u30fb\u308b\u3011 (u-verb) &#8211; to get angry<\/li>\n<li>\u9244\u62f3 \u3010\u3066\u3063\u30fb\u3051\u3093\u3011 &#8211; fist<\/li>\n<li>\u4f11\u307f \u3010\u3084\u3059\u30fb\u307f\u3011 &#8211; rest; vacation<\/li>\n<li>\u98f2\u3080 \u3010\u306e\u30fb\u3080\u3011 (u-verb) &#8211; to drink<\/li>\n<li>\u660e\u65e5 \u3010\u3042\u3057\u305f\u3011 &#8211; tomorrow<\/li>\n<li>\u6620\u753b \u3010\u3048\u3044\u30fb\u304c\u3011 &#8211; movie<\/li>\n<li>\u898b\u308b \u3010\u307f\u30fb\u308b\u3011 (ru-verb) &#8211; to see<\/li>\n<li>\u884c\u304f \u3010\u3044\u30fb\u304f\u3011 (u-verb) &#8211; to go<\/li>\n<li>\u53cb\u9054 \u3010\u3068\u3082\u30fb\u3060\u3061\u3011 &#8211; friend<\/li>\n<li>\u904a\u3076 \u3010\u3042\u305d\u30fb\u3076\u3011 (u-verb) &#8211; to play<\/li>\n<li>\u697d\u3057\u3080 \u3010\u305f\u306e\u30fb\u3057\u3080\u3011 (u-verb) &#8211; to enjoy<\/li>\n<li>\u51fa\u3059 \u3010\u3060\u30fb\u3059\u3011 (u-verb) &#8211; to bring out<\/li>\n<li>\u8d70\u308b \u3010\u306f\u3057\u30fb\u308b\u3011 (u-verb) &#8211; to run<\/li>\n<li>\u8d70\u308a\u51fa\u3059 \u3010\u306f\u3057\u30fb\u308a\u30fb\u3060\u30fb\u3059\u3011 (u-verb) &#8211; to break into a run<\/li>\n<li>\u7740\u308b \u3010\u304d\u30fb\u308b\u3011 (ru-verb) &#8211; to wear<\/li>\n<li>\u66ff\u3048\u308b \u3010\u304b\u30fb\u3048\u308b\u3011 (ru-verb) &#8211; to switch<\/li>\n<li>\u7740\u66ff\u3048\u308b \u3010\u304d\u30fb\u304c\u30fb\u3048\u308b\u3011 (ru-verb) &#8211; to change (clothes)<\/li>\n<li>\u4ed8\u3051\u308b \u3010\u3064\u30fb\u3051\u308b\u3011 (ru-verb) &#8211; to attach<\/li>\n<li>\u52a0\u3048\u308b \u3010\u304f\u308f\u30fb\u3048\u308b\u3011 (ru-verb) &#8211; to add<\/li>\n<li>\u4ed8\u3051\u52a0\u3048\u308b \u3010\u3064\u30fb\u3051\u30fb\u304f\u308f\u30fb\u3048\u308b\u3011 (ru-verb) &#8211; to add one thing to another<\/li>\n<li>\u8a00\u3046 \u3010\u3044\u30fb\u3046\u3011 (u-verb) &#8211; to say<\/li>\n<li>\u8a00\u3044\u51fa\u3059 \u3010\u3044\u30fb\u3044\u30fb\u3060\u30fb\u3059\u3011 (u-verb) &#8211; to start talking<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>In order to conjugate all u-verbs and ru-verbs into their respective polite forms, we will first learn about the stem of verbs.

While the \u300c\u306e\u300d particle allows you to talk about verbs as if they were nouns, the stem actually turns verbs into nouns. In fact, in very rare cases, the stem is used more often than the verb itself. For example, the stem of \u300c<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u3044\u304b\u308b - to get angry\">\u6012\u308b<\/span>\u300d\uff08\u3044\u304b\u308b\uff09 is used more often than the verb itself. The movie, &#8220;Fists of Fury&#8221; is translated as \u300c<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u3044\u304b\u308a - fury\">\u6012\u308a<\/span>\u306e<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u3066\u3063\u3051\u3093 - fist\">\u9244\u62f3<\/span>\u300d and not \u300c<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u304a\u3053\u308b - to get angry\">\u6012\u308b<\/span><span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u3066\u3063\u3051\u3093 - fist\">\u9244\u62f3<\/span>\u300d. In fact, \u300c<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u304a\u3053\u308b - to get angry\">\u6012\u308b<\/span>\u300d will most likely be read as \u300c<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u304a\u3053\u308b - to get angry\">\u304a\u3053\u308b<\/span>\u300d, a completely different verb with the same meaning and kanji! There are a number of specific nouns (such as \u300c<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u3084\u3059\u307f - rest, vacation\">\u4f11\u307f<\/span>\u300d) that are really verb stems that are used like regular nouns. However, in general we cannot take any verb and make it into a noun. For example, the following sentence is wrong.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">\u98f2\u307f\u3092<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u3059\u308b - to do\">\u3059\u308b<\/span><\/span>\u3002<br \/>\n(This sentence makes sense but no one talks like this)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>However, a useful grammar that works in general for stems of all verbs is using the stem as a target with a motion verb (almost always \u300c\u884c\u304f\u300d and \u300c\u6765\u308b\u300d in this case). This grammar means, &#8220;to go or to come to do [some verb]&#8221;.

For example, when \u300c<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u3060\u3059 - to bring out\">\u51fa\u3059<\/span>\u300d is attached to the stem of \u300c<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u306f\u3057\u308b - to run\">\u8d70\u308b<\/span>\u300d, which is \u300c<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u306f\u3057\u308b - to run\">\u8d70\u308a<\/span>\u300d, you get \u300c<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u306f\u3057\u308a\u3060\u3059 - to break into a run\">\u8d70\u308a\u51fa\u3059<\/span>\u300d meaning &#8220;to break out into a run&#8221;.

You can see how the separate meanings of the two verbs are combined to create the new combined verb.

There are no general rules here, you need to just memorize these combined verbs as separate verbs in their own right.<\/p>\n<p>Things that are written in a formal context such as newspaper articles also use the stem as a conjunctive verb.

It is impossible to fully explain the reasons why they are fundamentally different without discussing grammar that have yet to be covered so I would like to target this toward those who have already started learning Japanese and have been incorrectly misinformed that \u300c\u3060\u300d is the casual version of \u300c\u3067\u3059\u300d.

But the fact that \u300c<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u305d\u3046 - that's so, that's right\">\u305d\u3046<\/span>\u3067\u3059\u304b\u300d is a valid question shows that \u300c\u3067\u3059\u300d and \u300c\u3060\u300d are essentially different. \u300c<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u305d\u3046 - that's so, that's right\">\u305d\u3046<\/span>\u3067\u3059\u300d, in showing respect and humbleness, is not as assertive and is merely the polite version of \u300c<span class=\"popup\" title=\"\u305d\u3046 - that's so, that's right\">\u305d\u3046<\/span>\u300d.<\/p>\n<p>Besides the difference in nuance between \u300c\u3060\u300d and \u300c\u3067\u3059\u300d, another key difference is that \u300c\u3060\u300d is used in many different types of grammar to delineate a relative clause. \u300c\u3067\u3059\u300d, on the other hand, is only used at the end of a sentence to designate a polite state-of-being.
