This post is in English as well, so really, you probably should stop reading and spend your time on something more productive.<\/p>\n<p>When I first started writing the grammar guide, I wanted to cover every possible topic. Today however, my goal is to kick you out of the bird&#8217;s nest so to speak but perhaps a bit more gently than a sink-or-swim approach. I certainly DO NOT expect visitors to be reading about every nuance in grammar or vocabulary in English, especially those who have already mastered the basics. My primary goal is to cover the core concepts and illustrate <i>how to teach yourself<\/i> and maybe even have some fun in the process. Teach a man to fish and all that jazz.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you understand all the particles, sentence structure, and how to use dictionaries to learn new vocabulary, maybe it&#8217;s time to consider trying to fly out of the nest. Take your time though, I won&#8217;t kick you out!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/guidetojapanese.org\/learn\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/kicked_out-300x188.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1087\" srcset=\"https:\/\/guidetojapanese.org\/learn\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/kicked_out-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/guidetojapanese.org\/learn\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/kicked_out.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As a fellow Japanese learner, I should probably be writing this in Japanese too&#8230; \u3067\u3082\u3001\u3081\u3093\u3069\u304f\u3055\u3044\u304b\u3089\u3084\u3081\u3068\u3053\u3046\u3002<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Originally published: 2012\/11\/30 This post is about how you shouldn&#8217;t be reading this post.
