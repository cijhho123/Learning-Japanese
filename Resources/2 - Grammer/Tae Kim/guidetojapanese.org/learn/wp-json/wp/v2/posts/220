It is also important to address yourself with the proper level of politeness.  Japanese is special in that there are so many ways of saying the simple words, &#8220;I&#8221; and &#8220;you&#8221;.  We will go over some of ways to refer to yourself and others.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"part2\">Referring to yourself<\/h2>\n<h3>Vocabulary<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\u540d\u524d \u3010\u306a\u30fb\u307e\u3048\u3011 &#8211; name<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are many ways to say &#8220;I&#8221; in Japanese.  Some of these words are not as common and others are hopelessly outdated.  We will go over the most common ones that are in use today.  The usages of all the different words for &#8220;I&#8221; is separated into two categories: gender and politeness.  In other words, there are words that are usually used by males and words that are usually only used by females and they all depend on the social context.<\/p>\n<p>Before going into this: a note about the word \u300c<span title=\"\u308f\u305f\u3057 - me, myself, I\" class=\"popup\">\u79c1<\/span>\u300d.  The official reading of the kanji is \u300c<span title=\"\u308f\u305f\u304f\u3057 - me, myself, I\" class=\"popup\">\u308f\u305f\u304f\u3057<\/span>\u300d.  This is the reading you use in a formal context (for example, a speech by the president of a company).  This reading will probably be accompanied with honorific and humble forms, which we will cover later.  In all other situations, it is usually read as \u300c<span title=\"\u308f\u305f\u3057 - me, myself, I\" class=\"popup\">\u308f\u305f\u3057<\/span>\u300d.  This is the most generic reference to &#8220;I&#8221; in terms of politeness and gender; therefore it is usually one of the first words taught to students of Japanese.<\/p>\n<p>Here is a list of the most common words for &#8220;I&#8221; and how they are used:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span title=\"\u308f\u305f\u304f\u3057 - me, myself, I (formal)\" class=\"popup\">\u79c1<\/span> \u3010\u308f\u305f\u304f\u3057\u3011 &#8211; Used by both males and females for formal situations.<\/li>\n<li><span title=\"\u308f\u305f\u3057 - me, myself, I\" class=\"popup\">\u79c1<\/span> \u3010\u308f\u305f\u3057\u3011 &#8211; Used by both males and females for normal polite situations.<\/li>\n<li><span title=\"\u307c\u304f - me, myself, I\" class=\"popup\">\u50d5<\/span> \u3010\u307c\u304f\u3011 &#8211; Used primarily by males from fairly polite to fairly casual situations.<\/li>\n<li><span title=\"\u304a\u308c - me, myself, I\" class=\"popup\">\u4ffa<\/span> \u3010\u304a\u308c\u3011 &#8211; A very rough version of &#8220;I&#8221; used almost exclusively by males in very casual situations.<\/li>\n<li><span title=\"\u3042\u305f\u3057 - me, myself, I\" class=\"popup\">\u3042\u305f\u3057<\/span> &#8211; A very feminine and casual way to refer to oneself.

I hope that the examples with Bob, Alice, and Jim have shown that people refer to other people by their names even when they are directly addressing that person.  Another common way to address people is by their title such as \u300c<span title=\"\u3057\u3083\u3061\u3087\u3046 - company president\" class=\"popup\">\u793e\u9577<\/span>\u300d\u3001\u300c<span title=\"\u304b\u3061\u3087\u3046 - section manager\" class=\"popup\">\u8ab2\u9577<\/span>\u300d\u3001\u300c<span title=\"\u305b\u3093\u305b\u3044 - teacher\" class=\"popup\">\u5148\u751f<\/span>\u300d, etc.  The word \u300c<span title=\"\u305b\u3093\u305b\u3044 - teacher\" class=\"popup\">\u5148\u751f<\/span>\u300d is used to generally mean any person who has significant knowledge and expertise in something.  For example, people usually use \u300c<span title=\"\u305b\u3093\u305b\u3044 - teacher\" class=\"popup\">\u5148\u751f<\/span>\u300d when directly addressing doctors or teachers (obviously).  You can also include the person&#8217;s last name such as \u300c\u7530\u4e2d<span title=\"\u305b\u3093\u305b\u3044 - teacher\" class=\"popup\">\u5148\u751f<\/span>\u300d (teacher Tanaka).  In the case where your relationship with the person doesn&#8217;t involve any title, you can use their name (usually their last name) attached with \u300c\u3055\u3093\u300d to show politeness.  If calling them by their last name seems a little too polite and distant, the practice of attaching \u300c\u3055\u3093\u300d to their first name also exists.  More endearing and colloquial versions of \u300c\u3055\u3093\u300d include \u300c\u304f\u3093\u300d and \u300c\u3061\u3083\u3093\u300d.  \u300c\u304f\u3093\u300d is usually attached to the name of males who are of equal or lower social position.  (For example, my boss sometimes calls me \u300c\u30ad\u30e0\u304f\u3093\u300d). \u300c\u3061\u3083\u3093\u300d is a very endearing way to refer to usually females of equal or lower social position.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"part4\">Referring to others with &#8220;you&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Please do not use \u300c<span title=\"\u3042\u306a\u305f - you\" class=\"popup\">\u3042\u306a\u305f<\/span>\u300d just like you would use the word &#8220;you&#8221; in English. In directly addressing people, there are three levels of politeness: 1) Using the person&#8217;s name with the appropriate suffix, 2) Not using anything at all, 3) Using \u300c<span title=\"\u3042\u306a\u305f - you\" class=\"popup\">\u3042\u306a\u305f<\/span>\u300d.  In fact, by the time you get to three, you&#8217;re dangerously in the area of being rude.  Most of the time, you do not need to use anything at all because you are directly addressing the person.

(It could be worse, try learning Korean!)  For the purpose of brevity, (since this <i>is<\/i> a grammar guide and not a vocabulary guide) we will only go over the immediate family.  In Japanese, you refer to members of other people&#8217;s family more politely than your own.  This is only when you are talking about members of your own family to others <u>outside the family<\/u>.  For example, you would refer to your own mother as \u300c<span title=\"\u306f\u306f - mother\" class=\"popup\">\u6bcd<\/span>\u300d to people outside your family but you might very well call her \u300c<span title=\"\u304a\u304b\u3042\u3055\u3093 - mother\" class=\"popup\">\u304a\u6bcd\u3055\u3093<\/span>\u300d at home within your own family.  There is also a distinction between older and younger siblings.  The following chart list some of the most common terms for family members.
