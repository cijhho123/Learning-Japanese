While the word &#8220;basic&#8221; has a connotation of meaning &#8220;easy&#8221; (eg Visual Basic), this is not the case for Japanese. The most basic ideas in Japanese are the hardest to grasp because the fundamental differences between English and Japanese leaves out any way to actually express the idea in English. Unless you speak a similar language like Korean *eh hem*, you&#8217;re going to have to wrestle with a concept that doesn&#8217;t even exist in your native language. One such example is the idea of particles and especially the particles \u300c\u306f\u300d and \u300c\u304c\u300d.<\/p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s the difference between \u300c\u306f\u300d and \u300c\u304c\u300d?<\/h2>\n<p>I wish I had a nickel for every time I heard the question, &#8220;What is the difference between the \u300c\u306f\u300d and \u300c\u304c\u300d particle?&#8221; This question has successfully managed to baffle countless generations of people learning Japanese.  This has been followed by countless number of <a href=\"http:\/\/japanese.about.com\/library\/weekly\/aa051301a.htm\">equally confusing (and sometimes wrong) explanations<\/a> involving a great deal of mumbo-jumbo such as contrast, emphasis, subordinate clauses, and voodoo magic. However, with my genius, I was able to provide a complete explanation in one small sentence.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><b>\u300c\u306f\u300d and \u300c\u304c\u300d have different meanings.<\/b><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I think the more appropriate question would be, &#8220;What <b>isn&#8217;t<\/b> different about \u300c\u306f\u300d and \u300c\u304c\u300d?&#8221; You may be thinking, &#8220;But in English, they both identify the subject of the sentence.&#8221; Ahh, English. Isn&#8217;t English that language that can&#8217;t even express the very concept of \u300c\u306f\u300d and \u300c\u304c\u300d? Well, no wonder it looks the same in <b>that<\/b> language. That&#8217;s like a red-green color-blind person holding a red and green sheet of paper and saying, &#8220;Hey, isn&#8217;t this the same color?&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Japanese: A language of context<\/h2>\n<p>Since \u300c\u306f\u300d and \u300c\u304c\u300d mean totally different things, the only thing we need to do in order to identify their differences is to fully understand what they actually mean and why they exist. The first thing we need to realize is that a Japanese sentence is not required to have a subject. You can just say, &#8220;Hit ball&#8221; and you&#8217;re good to go.  So how do you know what the heck everybody is talking about?<\/p>\n<p>Well, there are several ways and they all involve making assumptions from context.  For example, if I suddenly asked you, &#8220;Ate lunch?&#8221; you assume I&#8217;m asking if <b>you<\/b> ate lunch because I&#8217;m surely not talking about anyone else. Therefore, you answer, &#8220;Ate lunch.&#8221; Then I assume you are talking about yourself since I just asked you the question and so I now know that you ate lunch. However, if we happened to be talking about Alice when I asked you the question, you will likely assume that I&#8217;m asking if Alice ate lunch because that&#8217;s who we were talking about.<\/p>\n<h2>Ok, so what does \u300c\u306f\u300d mean?<\/h2>\n<p>If we take a language like Japanese where the subject is so heavily based on context, we need to be able to identify a couple things. While making assumptions from context will work for simple question and answer sessions, anything more complicated will soon become a mess as everybody starts to lose track of who or what they&#8217;re talking about. Therefore, we need to be able to tell the listener when we want to change the current topic to say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m going to talk about <b>this<\/b> now. So don&#8217;t assume I&#8217;m still talking about the old thing.&#8221; This is especially important when you strike up a new conversation and you need to tell the listener what you&#8217;re talking about. This is what the \u300c\u306f\u300d particle does; it introduces a different topic from the current one. For that reason, it is also referred to as the &#8216;topic particle&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>Lets take the previous example where I wanted to ask you if you ate. The conversation might look like the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMe) <span title=\"\u305f\u3079\u308b - to eat\" class=\"popup\">\u98df\u3079\u305f<\/span>\uff1f &#8211; Did <em>you<\/em> eat?<br \/>\nYou) <span title=\"\u305f\u3079\u308b - to eat\" class=\"popup\">\u98df\u3079\u305f<\/span>\u3002 &#8211; I ate.\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Now, what if I wanted to ask you if Alice ate? Then I need to use the \u300c\u306f\u300d particle to indicate that I&#8217;m talking about Alice. Otherwise, you would just assume I&#8217;m talking about you.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMe) \u30a2\u30ea\u30b9<em>\u306f<\/em><span title=\"\u305f\u3079\u308b - to eat\" class=\"popup\">\u98df\u3079\u305f<\/span>\uff1f &#8211; Did <em>Alice<\/em> eat?<br \/>\nYou) <span title=\"\u305f\u3079\u308b - to eat\" class=\"popup\">\u98df\u3079\u305f<\/span>\u3002 &#8211; She ate.\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Notice how once I establish Alice as the new topic, we can continue to assume that we are talking about her until someone changes the topic.<\/p>\n<h2>So what does \u300c\u304c\u300d mean then?<\/h2>\n<p>Ok, so we can introduce a new topic using the \u300c\u306f\u300d particle. But what if we don&#8217;t know what the topic is? What if I wanted to ask, &#8220;Who ate the chicken?&#8221; What I need is some kind of <i>identifier<\/i> because I don&#8217;t know who ate the chicken. If I used the \u300c\u306f\u300d particle, the question would become, &#8220;Did who eat the chicken?&#8221; and that doesn&#8217;t make any sense because &#8220;who&#8221; is not an actual person.<\/p>\n<p>This is where the \u300c\u304c\u300d particle comes into play. It is also referred to as the subject particle but I hate that name since it means something completely different in English grammar. Instead, I move to call it the <i>identifier<\/i> particle because it identifies something unknown.<\/p>\n<p>The conversation about the chicken-eater culprit might go something like this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMe) <span title=\"\u3060\u308c- who\" class=\"popup\">\u8ab0<\/span><em>\u304c<\/em><span title=\"\u30c1\u30ad\u30f3 - chicken\" class=\"popup\">\u30c1\u30ad\u30f3<\/span>\u3092<span title=\"\u305f\u3079\u308b - to eat\" class=\"popup\">\u98df\u3079\u305f<\/span>\uff1f &#8211; Who ate the chicken?<br \/>\nYou) \u30a2\u30ea\u30b9<em>\u304c<\/em><span title=\"\u305f\u3079\u308b - to eat\" class=\"popup\">\u98df\u3079\u305f<\/span>\u3002 &#8211; Alice [is the one who] ate it.\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Notice that the \u300c\u304c\u300d particle is used twice because you need to identify who ate the chicken in the answer. You can&#8217;t say \u300c\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9<em>\u306f<\/em><span title=\"\u305f\u3079\u308b - to eat\" class=\"popup\">\u98df\u3079\u305f<\/span>\u3002\u300d because we&#8217;re not talking about Alice. We&#8217;re trying to identify the unknown person that ate the chicken.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Now, that I&#8217;ve clearly explained what \u300c\u306f\u300d and \u300c\u304c\u300d means, I hope this will finally clear up that question that has been haunting your mind. Remember, if you are talking about something new, use \u300c\u306f\u300d. If you are trying to identify something unknown, use \u300c\u304c\u300d.
