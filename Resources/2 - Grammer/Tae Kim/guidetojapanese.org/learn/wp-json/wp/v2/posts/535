It&#8217;s best to pick it up by ear as you gain experience with conversation practice. For the beginner however, it can be quite confusing to read or hear slang that can&#8217;t be found in the dictionary.<\/p>\n<p>In this section, we&#8217;ll take a look at some patterns in order to understand many common types of slang.<\/p>\n<h2>Using \u300c\u306e\u300d vs \u300c\u304b\u300d for questions<\/h2>\n<p>One common area of confusion is whether to use \u300c\u306e\u300d or \u300c\u304b\u300d to ask questions in casual speech. Previously, we learned that \u300c\u306e\u300d is used to ask for or give additional explanation. This is the same for both polite and casual speech.<\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\u4eca\u304b\u3089\u6642\u9593\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3002<br \/>\nDo (you) have time from now?<\/li>\n<li>\u4eca\u304b\u3089\u6642\u9593\u3042\u308b\uff1f<br \/>\nDo (you) have time from now?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\u4eca\u304b\u3089\u6642\u9593\u304c\u3042\u308b<em>\u306e<\/em>\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002<br \/>\n(Why do) you have time from now?<\/li>\n<li>\u4eca\u304b\u3089\u6642\u9593\u304c\u3042\u308b<em>\u306e<\/em>\uff1f<br \/>\n(Why do) you have time from now?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\u300c\u304b\u300d on the other hand, is very different when used in casual speech from what we&#8217;re used to in polite speech. It&#8217;s often used to either confirm something, make a rhetorical question, or show disbelief or doubt. In order words, it&#8217;s rarely a real question at all. It&#8217;s also more rough and masculine in tone.<\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\u305d\u3093\u306a\u3053\u3068\u3001\u4ffa\u304c\u77e5\u308b<em>\u304b<\/em>\u3088\uff1f\uff01<br \/>\nLike I would know that kind of thing!<\/li>\n<li>\u3053\u308c\u3067\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u5927\u4e08\u592b<em>\u304b<\/em>\uff1f<br \/>\nIs it really ok with this?<\/li>\n<li>\u307e\u3042\u3001\u3044\u3044<em>\u304b<\/em>\u3002<br \/>\nAh well, whatever, (it&#8217;s) fine.<\/li>\n<li>\u3082\u3046\u9045\u3044\u3057\u3001\u305d\u308d\u305d\u308d\u5e30\u308b<em>\u304b<\/em>\u3002<br \/>\nIt&#8217;s already late so shall (we) go home soon?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>In conclusion, if you want to ask an actual question in casual speech, you&#8217;ll most likely want to use either \u300c\u306e\u300d or just a rising intonation.<\/p>\n<h2>Shortening \/r\/ sounds to \u300c\u3093\u300d<\/h2>\n<p>Many sounds get shortened or slurred together in slang just like any other language. For Japanese, the \/r\/ sounds in particular often get slurred into \u300c\u3093\u300d. This is definitely a useful pattern to be aware of as it will make sense of a lot of words you wouldn&#8217;t normally find in a dictionary.<\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\u3088\u304f\u308f\u304b<em>\u3093<\/em>\u306a\u3044\u3002\uff08from \u5206\u304b<em>\u3089<\/em>\u306a\u3044\uff09<br \/>\n(I) don&#8217;t get really get it.<\/li>\n<li>\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u3001\u305d\u3053\u3092\u3069\u3044\u3066\u304f<em>\u3093<\/em>\u306a\u3044\uff1f\uff08from \u304f<em>\u308c<\/em>\u306a\u3044\uff09<br \/>\nHey, can (you) move from there a bit?\n<\/li>\n<li>\u4f55\u3057\u3066<em>\u3093<\/em>\u306e\uff1f\uff08from \u3057\u3066<em>\u308b<\/em>\uff09<br \/>\nWhatcha doing?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Casual speech patterns and slang in any language is rich, diverse, and constantly evolving so it&#8217;s difficult to really pin down &#8220;rules&#8221; on how to learn it.
