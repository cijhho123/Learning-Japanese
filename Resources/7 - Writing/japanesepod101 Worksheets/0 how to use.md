# How the Japanese alphabet worksheet works
The first thing any beginner should learn is the alphabet. However, most schools can take a week to teach you the alphabet. But, with these worksheets, you can learn the alphabet in an hour or less!

Just practice writing out the characters inside the worksheet. You’ll even get a chance to practice writing a few simple words. Once you’re done with the alphabet worksheet, feel free to move on to the other Japanese worksheet PDFs.

# Here’s how the Japanese writing worksheets work:
In the first part, you’ll get the Japanese word and its meaning, and your job is to write the word in Japanese.

In the second part, you get the Japanese word without any translations. Your job is to write the English translation here.

The third part will test your ability to recall the Japanese words. Here, you only get the English translation. Your job is to try and remember the Japanese word and write it out on the provided line.

By the end, you’ll remember the words because you’re tested on them in multiple ways: 1) recalling the meaning of the Japanese word and 2) recalling the Japanese word from the English translation.

You can also print out several copies of the Japanese worksheet PDFs in order to get extra practice.
