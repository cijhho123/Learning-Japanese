To help you pick up on the difference between Eastern and Western sarcasm, I’ve tagged some of the better / more obvious examples.

<p>Well, back in the pre-WWII days, Japan did the same thing.</p>

<p>Today if they want to import a new word, like ‘customer support’ they’ll use katakana: カストマー・サッポト。 But back in the  Pearl Harbor  days, speaking the words of inferior mongrels was pretty gauche. What they’d do instead was, break the foreign compound word down into its basic parts, then find the kanji which corresponded to those parts, and combine those kanji to make a new Japanese word – a NEOLOGISM.</p>

<p>For instance, wheel-chair became 車椅子　（car-chair), and space-ship became 宇宙船 (universe vessel).</p>

<p>Of course, these ‘pure Japanese’ words were written in Chinese, but whatever. When have racists ever made sense?</p>

The good news is, it turns out you don’t really need to learn sidekick kanji. Once you’ve learned the OTHER, more USEFUL kanji of the compound word, make a flashcard of the whole word, and learn the sidekick that way.

貝 (’sea shell’) is a classic SOLO kanji.

Fortunately, the jukugo all mean ’sea shell’, so 貝 is not a COCK – there’s no exceptions to the meaning or ponunciation.
<br>
Since 貝 is used by itself, so usually you can get away with not learning the ONyomi. This is why it helps you to learn the SOLO tag.

Also, even if a kanji is used often in compounds, BUT IS PRONOUNCED   WITH ITS KUNYOMI, it’ll get a SOLO tag – since you still don’t need to learn the ON!</p>

<td><p> (newspaper word)</p>

<p>All languages have a very formal version, even English: (“Your Honour, if it please the court to introduce the writ of habeas corpus?” “Indubitably, my good chap!”) But as usual, Japanese has to take a common linguistic phenomenon and bug it out until it’s totally incomprehensible to foreigners.</p>

<p>So, in ADDITION to the formal Japanese (used only when talking to the Boss) , there’s a WHOLE ‘NOTHER SET OF WORDS which are used in very informal,  every-day settings: announcements on the loudspeakers of train stations, television news reports, newspapers, etc.</p>

<p>Some of these words are the most common and useful in Japanese, and yet most people will never ever say them.</p>

<p>These words are only HEARD or READ, but they’re not SAID.</p>

<p>I call these words NEWSPAPER WORDS, although they might be better called ANNOUNCEMENT WORDS.</p>

<p>A common noob mistake is when a foreigner (having just learned the words) says them out loud. The foreigner figured that since they describe common things like trains leaving the station, they must be useful. Ha! NOOOOB. To make matters even worse, most every NEWSPAPER WORD has a more casual equivalent that regular folks use, and you gotta learn those too!</p>

<td><p> is short for ‘STRONG RADICAL,’ which means ‘radical that usually controls the pronunciation of any kanji in which it is a component.’ For example,   Both 可 (on-yomi: KA) and and 中 (on-yomi: CHUU) are STRONG.
<br>
So if you see a kanji with the 可 radical  inside it, (i.e.苛、何, 河, or 歌 )most likely their ONyomi will also be KA. Likewise, if you see a kanji with 中 inside it, (i.e. 虫、忠, or 仲　)the ONyomi of that kanji will probably also be CHUU.
<br>
Strong radicals are good because they help you guess the ON-yomi of kanji that you can’t read.
<br>
But BE CAREFUL of kanji such as 己. 己’s ONyomi is KO, but most of the kanji which use the 己 radical have the ONyomi of "KI", not KO!!!!
<br>
In cases like that, I’ll write a  warning tag which says something like: "STRONG RADICAL FOR ‘KI’"</p>

<p>火 (fire) is used in words like 焼 (roast)、　燃 (burn)、　爆 (explode)、　and 　災 (natural disaster).</p>

<p>One more thing: SYMBOLIC  RADICALS are usually on the left side, STRONG RADICALS are usually located on the right side of a kanji. So if you are stumped by a new (or, heh, forgotten) kanji, check the right-side radical for clues to its on-yomi. And check the left-side radical for clues to its meaning.</p>

<td><p>Yet another only-in-Japanese type of problem : Synonyms where the kanji look as physically similar as their meanings! 　“Hey, a few foreigners managed to suss out the difference in the meanings of these synonyms. We can’t let that slide. . . why don’t we make them look almost identical too?? That’ll slow ‘em down . . .IN YOUR FACE, FOREIGNERS!!!”</p>

<p>Classic ILL PAIRS ? Here’s a few:
<br>
削　(ｗｈｉｔｔｌｅ　ｄｏｗｎ) /消 (ｅｒａｓｅ)
<br>
福 (good luck) / 富 ( get rich )
<br>
近 (close) /辺 (around here)
<br>
王　(king) / 主　(master)
<br>
妻 ( wife) / 婦 – (housewife)
<br>
Unlike most of these WARNING TAGS, learning ill pairs doesn’t really help you in any way. But it’s so fucked up, I had to make a list of them. I guess you could show the list  to your Japanese teacher and try to get her to apologize personally to you.

<td><p>abunai (危ない) means ‘dangerous!’ ABUNAI kanji fall into 3 types:</p>

<ol>
<li>it’s a discrimination word.</li>
<li>it’s a word that might start a fight</li>
<li>it’s a word that will make Japanese giggle at you.</li>
</ol>


<p>Note that there's not a lot of kanji that are offensive by themselves (although there are plenty of kanji with <a href="https://www.kanjidamage.com/tags/9">politically incorrect</a> roots, which might be offensive or funny to gaijin).</p>

<p>But, when you combine two or more kanji together, you can make  plenty of  JUKUGO (compound words) that will offend people!</p>

<p>If you know the individual kanji, it's easy to recognize clearly offensive jukugo, even if you have never seen them before - 陰唇 (inshin) literally means 'shadow lips' or 'hidden lips'  and 巨根 (kyokon) literally means 'giant root.'  Take a wild guess, Einstein.</p>

<p>But, Japan being Japan, a lot of offensive or embarrassing terms are even more subtle. For instance, 事務所 (literally, 'office') is usually just that: an office. But often it's used to mean Yakuza, since mobsters here are as official and well-organized as big businesses.  Welcome to Japanese sarcasm.</p>

<p>Another example: 犯す (okasu). According to your dictionary, this means, 'to perpetrate.' What your dictionary DOESN'T tell you is that 犯す is almost always used in the context of rape. (also, it doesn't help that it sounds almost exactly like 'wake me up' (起こす, pronounced oKOsu), which has resulted in more than one embarrassing incident for me, but probably you don't have that problem).</p>

<p>Fortunately, Kanji Damage has a solution for you: offensive or dangerous kanji/jukugo are tagged with the label ABU (short for abunai 危ない, which means 'Danger!'). And, in the cases of words like 事務所 or 犯す, I will explain specifically why they might get you into trouble.</p>

<td><p>Yet another only-in-Japanese headache: All kanji are written as hiragana. . . TO SOME EXTENT.  So, should you even bother learning the kanji or not??? Textbooks and dictionaries offer no help to the pressed-for-time student.</p>

<p>For instance kanji words are generally written as hiragana in kids’ books, or simply to emphasize the word (like all-caps in English).</p>

<p>Then there’s words such as 帽子 (hat) or 沢山　（hella) which are written as hiragana about half the time.</p>

<p>Words like 居る (to live) or 可愛い (cute) are usually hiragana unless it’s a really formal (or pretentious!) book.</p>

<p>Words like 馬鹿 (idiot) or 凄い (deeeyamn!) are, inexplicably, usually written as KATAKANA.
<br>
Then there are words like 宜しく (yoroshiku= please)　or 有難う (arigatou= thanks ) which are never written as kanji  anymore – BUUUUT they still carry the pronunciation of the kanji.</p>

<p>Unlike some books or flashcards, I cut these words out so you don’t waste your time.
<br>
Furthermore, a lot of the <a href="https://www.kanjidamage.com/tags/6">DUPE</a> kanji are written as hiragana, simply because even Japanese people don’t have any fuckin’ idea which kanji to use!!!
<br>
And then there are literally hundreds of jukugo where the first kanji is written as kanji but the second kanji is always written as hiragana. Or vice versa. What the hell is up with that? Make up your minds, guys!! (one piece of good news: if a kanji is written as hiragana in one jukugo, it’ll probably be written as kana in all of its jukugo)
<br>
Anyway, if a word is usually written in hiragana/katakana, I give it the KANA tag, which means you can skip it.</p>

<td>32</td>
<td><p>I call it that because it’s even <a href="https://www.kanjidamage.com/tags/11">worse than a jerk</a> .  Like say the kanji is used in 20 compound words, and all 20 have the same general meaning (call it meaning A). Or it’s used in 20 words and in all of them it’s pronounced the same way (call it pronunciation A). The only exception is this ONE word that is pronounced in a fucked-up way and means something else (call it meaning B) totally unrelated. And guess what? In normal conversation, the ONLY TIME YOU ’LL EVER USE THE KANJI IS WITH MEANING ‘B’!<br/>
<br>
昨 is a typical COCK: It’s used in words like 昨月（さくげつ）、昨朝　（さくちょう）、昨日　（さくじつ）、　昨年（さくねん）、昨晩（さくばん）、昨報（さくほう）、and 昨夕（さくゆう）. But no one ever says those words. Instead, 昨 is only used in the context of 昨日（きのう） which is pronounced totally differently (ki instead of saku)  and means ‘yesterday.’
<br>
Now, that’s not only hard to learn, but it raises quantum-physics-level epistemological questions regarding "what does this kanji mean?" If you go by "how many words use that meaning of the kanji", then Meaning A is the winner by 90%. But if you go by "How frequently is the meaning used in everyday life?" then Meaning B is the winner by 90%.  How crazy is that??</p>
