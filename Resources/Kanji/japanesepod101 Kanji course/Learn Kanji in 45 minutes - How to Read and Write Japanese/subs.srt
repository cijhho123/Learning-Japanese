you'll learn exactly what kanji is and

14
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,799
why you need it the best method of

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,200
learning kanji and about the building

16
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,479
blocks that make up a kanji character

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,120
okay Risa let's get right into it first

18
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:47,119
let's explain what kanji is

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,280
exactly it's quite simple actually Kani

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,079
is the use of Chinese characters in

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,079
Japanese writing so Japanese actually

22
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,799
uses Chinese characters in part of its

23
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,799
writing that's that's because Japanese

24
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:06,879
writing actually originated from China

25
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:10,920
right right a long time ago Japan only

26
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:13,560
used Chinese Cales today we use three

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,560
different scripts together to write

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:22,000
Japanese those three scripts

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,280
areana kak and Kani so for comparison

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,239
English only uses one script the English

31
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,000
alphabet but Japanese uses three

32
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,519
different ones kanji is the

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,159
interpretation of Chinese characters

34
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,078
into Japanese and hiragana and Katakana

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,719
are scripts created after by Japanese

36
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,118
people you can kind of think of the

37
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:41,798
latter two as the Japanese alphabet we

38
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:43,280
refer to them as Ka learning Kana is

39
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,240
easy it's just like learning the

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,079
alphabet you learn a limited number of

41
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,239
letters and using those letters you can

42
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:50,639
put them together to form words on their

43
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:53,478
own though they don't really hold any

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,599
meaning kanji however is different there

45
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:58,438
are thousands of them and hidden beneath

46
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,399
each one lies a secret message one Kani

47
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:03,038
character can say more than 100 of these

48
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,680
letters because it represents an idea a

49
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,200
wealth of meaning can be uncovered from

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,200
this Single Character the concept and

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,239
meaning however will only reveal itself

52
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:16,679
if you know where to look and this is

53
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,640
the true power of Kani okay now that we

54
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,480
know what kanji is how do we actually

55
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,479
start learning

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,040
kanji there are many ways to start

57
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,400
learning Kani the most obvious way

58
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:33,039
although not the most effective

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,239
is to Simply memorize them like learning

60
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,199
the alphabet or learning new words you

61
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,120
can start learning kanji by memorizing a

62
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,399
few each day every day until you've

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,239
memorized them all unlike learning the

64
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,920
alphabet however which consists of only

65
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,439
a small set of letters there are

66
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:48,199
thousands and thousands of kanji

67
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,800
characters each with their own unique

68
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:53,639
concept and meaning you can memorize the

69
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,280
alphabet in a few days but memorizing

70
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,839
every country there is let's just say

71
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,560
that should be active for a very very

72
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,400
long time and and let's hope that you

73
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,680
don't forget a few along the way

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,439
memorizing each individual coni one by

75
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,599
one just isn't practical there are

76
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:10,199
simply too many of them thankfully

77
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:13,919
there's a more effective way to learn

78
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:13,919
Kani and that's by learning the

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,719
radicals a kanji character can be broken

80
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,920
down into smaller components these

81
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:23,519
smaller components are called radicals

82
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,318
you can think of radicals simply as the

83
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,519
building blocks of kanji every kanji

84
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,878
character has at least one radical

85
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,680
sometimes the radical itself can be a

86
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:38,399
Kani on its own and several radicals put

87
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,159
together could be another kji by

88
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,599
learning radical the building blocks of

89
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:45,759
kanji you can understand the general

90
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:48,359
meaning of kanji characters you've yet

91
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,438
to learn instead of learning individual

92
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,920
Kani characters one at a time we

93
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:54,078
essentially learn the building blocks

94
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,719
instead you only have to learn a few

95
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,079
radicals to be able to read some of the

96
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:00,079
most common kanji characters out there

97
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,319
in this series we'll teach you 10 ful

98
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,239
radicals that'll get you started

99
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:06,158
learning kanji quickly and easily we've

100

00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,120
and recap on what we've learned in this

103
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,798
lesson you learn that kanji is the

104
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,799
interpretation of Chinese characters

105
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,560
into Japanese writing kanji are

106
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,280
characters that represent an idea and

107
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,680
therefore contain a wealth of meaning

108
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:21,198
and the quickest and most effective way

109
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,639
to learn kanji is by watching this

you one of the most common useful and

114
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,120
basic radicals used in kanji the person

115
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:36,679
radical see you in the next lesson bye

116
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,959
bye hi everyone welcome to the Japanese

117
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,530
kanji video series in this lesson you'll

118
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:44,729
learn your very first radical the person

119
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:44,729
[Music]

120
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:50,159
radical take a look at these conji

121
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,600
characters can you guess what they

122
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,320
mean by the end of this lesson you'll be

123
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,919
able to grasp the meaning behind these

124
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,439
conji characters in the previous lesson

125
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:00,279
we learned that conji characters are

126
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,439
made up of radicals the building blocks

127
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,239
of kanji these radicals give us

128
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:07,000
tremendous Clues to the meaning behind

129
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,600
kanji characters can you identify the

130
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,360
common element in all of these conji

131
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,680
characters it's this part here this

132
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,720
particular radical is called me it's

133
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,240
otherwise known as the person radical

134
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,400
and it's used in some of the most common

135
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,120
of all kanji characters let's take a

136
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,120
look at it in more

137
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,960
detail on its own the person radical

138
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,240
looks like this we mentioned before that

139
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,758
some radicals can be kanji on their own

140
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,639
this radical is one such example the

141
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,319
meaning behind this particular coni is

142
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,519
human or person when this radical

143
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:45,720
appears as a part of another conji like

144
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:48,159
in these examples the appearance changes

145
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,520
slightly when it's a component like this

146
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,319
it adds the meaning of human or person

147
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:56,318
to the entire kanji character if you can

148
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,600
identify a ladal in a Kani character

149
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,400
there's a good chance that you can guess

150
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,439
the meaning of the character itself the

151
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:05,318
first kanji has the person radical

152
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,000
paired with this second character this

153
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:09,439
second character is also a common

154
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,759
radical and conji in itself it's the

155
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:15,360
character for tree when paired together

156
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:18,000
a person leaning on a tree means that

157
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,120
they're resting so this kanji character

158
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,639
means to rest the second kanji has the

159
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,918
person radical paired with this

160
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,038
character it's identical to the tree

161
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:29,159
character from before except with this

162
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,360
small horizontal line at the bottom the

163
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,639
meaning of this character is root or

164
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,759
trunk when paired together the root or

165
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,879
trunk of a person refers to their body

166
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,560
so this kji means body the last kanji

167
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:46,399
has the person radical paired with the

168
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:50,800
character for word human and word paired

169
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:52,279
together means trust or faith can you

170
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,079
see how we can determine the meaning of

171
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:56,159
each coni character by identifying the

172
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,519
radicals in them by following this

173
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,080
process we can deduce the meaning of

174
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,878
Kani characters we've yet to learn and

175
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:06,918
the more ladal you learn the easier it

176
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,919
will be to learn even more

177
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,439
Kani the person radical most commonly

178
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:14,639
occurs in the left position as can be

179
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:16,439
seen in these examples this will be the

180
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,598
position you'll most likely encounter it

181
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:22,560
in sometimes though you may find it in

182
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:25,360
the top of a Ki character this position

183
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,038
is known as the crown position as can be

184
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,720
seen in some of these examples however

185
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,399
this is L common just remember the left

186
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,400
and Crown positions and you'll be able

187
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:39,478
to identify the person radical okay now

188
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,478
let's learn how to write this

189
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,158
radical learning the stroke order of

190
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,719
radicals is important because it's

191
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:47,478
designed to help you flow from one

192
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,080
character to the next knowing how to

193
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:50,120
write a radical demonstrates

194
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:52,279
understanding of the components that

195
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,120
make up a kanji character while it may

196
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,318
not seem important at first particularly

197
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,879
for basic Kani characters learning the

198
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,520
proper stroke order is important down

199
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,560
the line when you learn more difficult

200
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,439
kanji some kanji characters are written

201
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,199
in many strokes and they can get very

202
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,038
complex so unless you're writing it in

203
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,879
the correct order the end result may be

204
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:12,318
unreadable therefore it's important for

205
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:14,919
you to know how to write each K

206
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,400
character in the correct order while

207
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:18,198
there are some rules to coni stroke

208
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,198
order there are no hard and fast rules

209
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,879
to learning them the more radicals you

210
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,598
learn how to write the easier and more

211
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:25,680
intuitive it will become to write whole

212
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,158
kanji characters now let's take a look

213
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,000
at the stroke order of the person

214
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:32,679
radical the person radical is is very

215
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,918
simple there are only two strokes when

216
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:38,718
the Lao is on its own it looks like this

217
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,718
the first stroke starts from the upper

218
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,760
Center and then carves down to the

219
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,278
bottom left the second stroke starts a

220
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:50,159
tiny bit below the first stroke and goes

221
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,200
directly to the bottom right when this

222
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,039
radical is a part of another conji it

223
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,200
usually takes on the left position and

224
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:57,958
the appearance is distorted a little the

225
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,759
first stroke goes from right to left at

226
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,119
the top and the second stroke stroke

227
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,639
attaches to the center of the first

228
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,039
stroke and goes all the way down when

229
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:08,879
the radical takes the crown position

230
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:11,399
it's written in much the same way it

231
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:14,958
starts from the upper Center going right

232
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:17,799
to left and then from left to right and

233
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,799
that's it you're

234
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,119
done Kani characters can have multiple

235
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,278
readings they're usually broken down

236
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,759
into two groups called on and kunon

237
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,799
readings the on reading mimics the

238
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,759
original sound made in Chinese while the

239
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:33,958
reading is a revised reading used

240
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,679
to integrate with the Japanese alphabet

241
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,159
the only way to determine which reading

242
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,719
to use is mainly via the context on

243
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,480
readings will usually be used when

244
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,480
multiple Kani characters are grouped

245
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,360
together into a compound word whereas

246
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,079
kunon readings will usually be used when

247
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,959
it's a standalone conji like in the

248
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:51,039
first example in the case of the

249
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,838
original examples the on and kunon

250
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:56,799
readings of each are as

251
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,800
follows yes for the conji meaning to

252
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,799
rest

253
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:07,399
for the body conji and shin for the

254
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,919
trust conji reading kji may be difficult

255
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:14,440
to start off this but they'll only get

256
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,439
easier as you learn more lus over

257
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,959
time in this lesson you learned about

258
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,359
the person radical the idea behind this

259
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,439
radical is person or human you also

260
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,680
learn the kanji characters for person

261
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,920
rest body and Trust in which this

262
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,519
radical appears it's most commonly found

263
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,479
in the left position making Mak it

264
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,360
appear like this and it's written with

265
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,519
two strokes going from right to left and

266
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,800
then top to bottom hi everyone welcome

267
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,560
to the Japanese kanji video series in

268
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:41,559
this lesson you'll learn the human legs

269
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,039
radical take a look at these coni

270
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,359
characters can you guess what they

271
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:51,958
mean by the end of this lesson you'll be

272
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,480
able to grasp the meaning behind these

273
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,838
Kani characters first off can you spot

274
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,320
the radical that's common in all of

275
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,880
these kanji

276
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,040
characters it's this part here it looks

277
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,919
like a pair of legs this particular

278
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:06,278
radical is

279
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:09,120
called

280
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:10,679
or it's the human legs radical and it's

281
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,679
used in some of the most common of all

282
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:14,679
kanji let's take a look at it in more

283
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,799
detail in some of the previous lessons

284
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,599
you learned that some radicals are conji

285
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:23,278
characters on their own this is the

286
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,680
first radical we've encountered that

287
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,000
isn't a kanji character in itself this

288
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:28,719
basically means that you'll only

289
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,078
encounter it as a component in other

290
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,720
conji character characters the meaning

291
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:37,359
behind this radical is legs particularly

292
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,920
those of a person unlike the previous

293
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,879
radicals that we've learned the meaning

294
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:43,159
of the human legs radical is less

295
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,759
literal It generally alludes more to the

296
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:47,240
sense of structural support that our

297
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,319
legs provide us with from left to right

298
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,278
the first kanji means origin or

299
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,760
Foundation the second means light or to

300
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:57,240
shine and the third character means to

301
00:11:54,759 --> 00:12:00,120
see if you think of these Kani

302
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,320
characters from the Viewpoint of SP the

303
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,959
meaning of each character makes much

304
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,720
more sense the first kanji has the human

305
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,719
legs radical at the bottom which is

306
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,800
connected to a wide horizontal line with

307
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,079
a smaller parallel horizontal line on

308
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,240
top the wide horizontal line represents

309
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:17,359
the body and the smaller horizontal line

310
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,959
represents the head notice how the legs

311
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,560
are connected and are supporting the

312
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:24,319
body the legs that are supporting the

313
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:27,078
body and head represent the foundation

314
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,800
or basis which is the meaning of this

315
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:31,719
Kani character the second kji has the

316
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,559
legs on the bottom once again with what

317
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,440
appears to be a fire burning on top Fire

318
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,439
evokes Light so the meaning of this

319
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,720
kanji is light and the foundation or

320
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,040
origin of the emitting Rays refers to

321
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,199
the point source light emanating from a

322
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:49,519
source means that it's shining so this

323
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:51,838
kanji can also mean to shine the final

324
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,120
kanji has human legs on the bottom

325
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:58,079
supporting the character for I and N

326
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:02,000
that is mobile is one that can see so

327
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,000
this Ki character means to

328
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,720
see the human legs radical will always

329
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:10,399
be at the bottom position where it's

330
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,879
supporting something just remember where

331
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,440
your legs are on your body and you won't

332
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:18,958
forget it where are your legs on the

333
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,120
bottom okay now let's learn how to write

334
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,119
this

335
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:27,039
radical the human legs radical only has

336
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,720
two strokes the first stroke starts near

337
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,838
the center and curves from right to the

338
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,240
bottom left left the second stroke also

339
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,880
starts near the center but it goes

340
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,320
straight down and then flattens out at

341
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:41,799
the floor only to flck Upward slightly

342
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,639
the beginning of each stroke usually

343
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:48,039
connects to another radical so keep that

344
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:48,039
in mind and that's it you're

345
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,599
done the human legs radical isn't a

346
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:55,919
kanji on its own so you'll only see it

347
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,120
as a part of another conji in the case

348
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:01,039
of the original examples common readings

349
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,039
are

350
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,120
for the origin or foundation

351
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:15,240
conji for the conji meaning to shine and

352
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,239
K for the conji meaning to

353
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,039
see in this lesson you learned about the

354
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:22,559
human legs radical the idea behind the

355
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:24,319
human legs radical is support this

356
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,559
radical isn't a Kani character on its

357
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,839
own so you'll only see it in other coni

358
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,638
characters such as the foundation shine

359
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,560
and C kanji characters that you learned

360
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,480
in this lesson You'll Always Find this

361
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,239
radical in the bottom position and it's

362
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,159
written with two vertical Strokes one

363
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,720
curved stroke and one that flattens out

364
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,439
and flicks upward slightly hi everyone

365
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,480
welcome to the Japanese kanji video

366
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,800
series in this lesson you'll learn the

367
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,800
10

368
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,199
radical take a look at these conji

369
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,759
characters can you guess what they

370
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,559
mean by the end of this lesson you'll be

371
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,278
able to grasp the meaning behind these

372
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:01,719
Kani characters first off can you spot

373
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:03,120
the radical that's common in all of

374
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,759
these Kani

375
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,399
characters it's this part here it looks

376
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:12,360
like a cross this particular radical is

377
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:15,039
called J which literally means 10 in

378
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,199
Japanese the 10 radical is used in some

379
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:20,360
of the most common kanji characters

380
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:20,359
let's take a look at it in more

381
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,560
detail the 10 radical means exactly that

382
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,638
10 but it also means completeness likely

383
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:32,919
because Chinese uses a BAS 10 number

384
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:36,000
system as you can see the 10 radical is

385
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:39,159
also a k character on its own from left

386
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,360
to right the first Ki means 10 the

387
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:43,799
second means thousand the third

388
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,959
character means noon and the fourth

389
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:49,000
character means old the second kanji has

390
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,879
the 10 radical at the bottom paired with

391
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,720
the person radical the very first

392
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,439
radical you learned we covered it in

393
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,079
lesson two in the olden days people

394
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,680
aspired to live to 100 so if one person

395
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,479
Liv to 100 then the idea is that 10

396
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:04,120
human lifetimes would equate to a

397
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,079
thousand which is the meaning of this

398
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,839
character thousand the third conji means

399
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:11,838
noon to remember this kanji identify

400
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,800
that the 10 radical is at the bottom and

401
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,279
imagine that the top two strokes signify

402
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:20,958
the number two 10 + 2 = 12 and 12 means

403
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:23,318
that it's noon the origin of the fourth

404
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,958
and final conji is a little contested

405
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:28,278
but it has the 10 radical on top below

406
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:30,198
it is mouth another useful radical which

407
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,600
we will learn in the the next lesson

408
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,599
it's thought that something that has

409
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,360
completed its cycle and relating to the

410
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,480
mouth means that it's old food or food

411
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:42,318
that has dried out when something is dry

412
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:47,759
it hardens and so this Ki carries a

413
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:47,759
sense of something that is old dry or

414
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:53,519
hard the 10 radical will usually sit in

415
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,639
the bottom position and connect with

416
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,480
another radical above it it can also be

417
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,120
in the crown position when it in this

418
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,120
position the bottom radical is likely to

419
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:08,359
be the mouse radical in which case it

420
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:11,838
add the sense of oldness dryness or

421
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:13,438
hardness that we talked about before be

422
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,078
careful when trying to identify this

423
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,959
radical though as there will often be

424
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:18,959
crosses in many kanji due to the nature

425
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,640
in which kanji characters are written

426
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,759
some characters may look like they use

427
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,480
the 10 radical but don't be fooled

428
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:27,640
here's a small list of characters which

429
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,200
do and do not use the 10

430
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,640
radical okay okay now let's learn how to

431
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,640
write this

432
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,200
radical the 10 radical is very simple it

433
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,240
only has two strokes the first stroke is

434
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,200
a horizontal one that goes from left to

435
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,160
right this horizontal stroke Rises ever

436
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,080
so slightly as it approaches the right

437
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,679
side the second stroke is a vertical

438
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,879
stroke that starts at the top and goes

439
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,480
down to the bottom splitting the first

440
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,360
horizontal stroke in half and forming a

441
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,319
cross sign when this radical is part of

442
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:03,959
another conji it'll usually connect to

443
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:08,839
another radical at the vertical ends of

444
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,840
the second stroke and that's it you're

445
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,200
done when the 10 radical is on its own

446
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:20,280
the kanji can be read as for the on

447
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:22,519
reading and to for the reading and when

448
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,519
the 10 radical is part of another conji

449
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:26,918
like in the original examples common

450
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,918
readings

451
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,079
are for the coni mean meaning

452
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,599
thousand for the conji meaning

453
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,200
noon for the conji meaning

454
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,559
old in this lesson you learned about the

455
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:48,038
10 radical the 10 radical looks like a

456
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:50,279
cross it signifies the number 10 and the

457
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:52,839
idea of completeness you also learn the

458
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:55,319
kanji characters for 10 thousand noon

459
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:56,879
and old in which this radical appears

460
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:58,759
it's commonly found in the bottom or

461
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,360
crown position and it's written with one

462
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:02,319
one horizontal stroke and one vertical

463
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:04,639
stroke hi everyone welcome to the

464
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:07,639
Japanese kanji video series in this

465
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,960
lesson you'll learn the mouth

466
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,080
[Music]

467
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,400
radical take a look at these conji

468
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,720
characters can you guess what they

469
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,400
mean by the end of this lesson you'll be

470
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,000
able to grasp the meaning behind these

471
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,400
kanji characters first off can you spot

472
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,240
the radical that's common in all of

473
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,159
these coni

474
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,720
characters it's this part here this

475
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,720
particular radical is called

476
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,839
or the mouth radical is used in some of

477
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:38,759
the most common Kani characters let's

478
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,759
take a look at it in more

479
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:46,000
detail the mouse radical stands for

480
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:47,519
exactly that the mouse keep in mind

481
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,359
though that it encapsulates the many

482
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,960
senses of the word mouth and isn't

483
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,279
limited to the mouth of a person or

484
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,200
animal the mouth of a river for instance

485
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,319
alludes to an opening where water moves

486
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,360
through to enter an ocean the mouth

487
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:03,000
radical embodies this sense of the word

488
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:06,279
too from left to right the first K means

489
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,038
MTH the second means older brother the

490
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:11,639
third character means old and the fourth

491
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:13,679
character means same this radical is a

492
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,159
conji by itself as seen in the first

493
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,120
example the second conji has the mouth

494
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,919
radical on top and the human legs

495
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:22,279
radical which we learned in lesson four

496
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,360
on the bottom the third conji has the

497
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:25,918
mouth radical on the bottom and the 10

498
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:29,639
radical which we learned in the previous

499
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:33,960
lesson on top do you remember this kji

500
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,880
kexa it's the ca for or the fourth kanji

501
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,440
has the mouth radical enclosed in a type

502
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,559
of hood representing a group a group of

503
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,640
people who share one voice have the same

504
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:46,639
opinion so the meaning of this kji is

505
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,640
same or

506
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,839
equal the mouth radical appears in

507
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:55,880
multiple positions it can appear in the

508
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:58,639
crown position like in the Kani for

509
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,360
older brother or it can appear at the

510
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,960
the bottom in the foot position like in

511
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:05,519
the Ki for

512
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,000
old and just as often it can appear in

513
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:10,679
the right position like in this SC

514
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,278
character meaning Harmony as you can see

515
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,480
the mouth radical appears in many

516
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:17,960
different positions so keep your eyes

517
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,200
peeled okay now let's learn how to write

518
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,200
this

519
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,678
radical the mouth radical is very simple

520
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,000
it's written in three strokes and it

521
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,720
looks like a box the first stroke occurs

522
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,079
on the left side and is a vertical

523
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,679
stroke that goes from top to bottom the

524
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,839
second looks like a right corner and

525
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,000
starts from left to right and then bends

526
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:41,278
downwards it's important to note that

527
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,640
this second stroke should be completed

528
00:21:41,278 --> 00:21:46,278
in one smooth motion finally close the

529
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,720
Box by connecting the first stroke to

530
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:51,839
the second stroke at the bottom and

531
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,839
that's it you're

532
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:59,119
done when the mouth radical is on its

533
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:03,558
own the Kani can be read as coold for

534
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:05,158
the own reading and for the reading and

535
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:07,480
when the mouth radical is a part of

536
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,480
another

537
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,759
conji for the older brother

538
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:18,079
kanji for the Kani meaning old

539
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:23,079
and for the conji meaning same or

540
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,759
equal in this lesson you learned about

541
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,159
the mouth radical the mouth radical

542
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,480
looks like a square

543
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:32,278
the idea behind this radical

544
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,519
encapsulates all senses of the word

545
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:36,519
mouth equivalent to English you also

546
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:39,319
learn the kanji characters for mouth

547
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:41,319
older brother old and same or equal in

548
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:43,359
which this radical appears it can be

549
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:45,558
found in multiple positions the crown

550
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:47,240
foot or right position and it's written

551
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:48,839
with one vertical stroke one right

552
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,159
corner stroke and one connecting

553
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:53,558
horizontal stroke hi everyone welcome to

554
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:57,720
the Japanese kanji video series in this

555
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:57,720
lesson you'll learn the one radical

556
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,559
take a look at these kanji characters

557
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,079
can you guess what they

558
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:07,918
mean by the end of this lesson you'll be

559
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,599
able to grasp the meaning behind these

560
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,038
conji characters first off can you spot

561
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:13,719
the radical that's common in all of

562
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:16,319
these kanji

563
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,079
characters it's this part here it's a

564
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:22,759
single horizontal stroke this particular

565
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:25,918
radical is called it which literally

566
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:28,200
means one the one radical is used in

567
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,520
some of the most common coni characters

568
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,519
let's let's take a look at it in more

569
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:39,159
detail the one radical means exactly

570
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:42,159
that the number one from left to right

571
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:45,760
the first Ki means one the second means

572
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:48,278
word or era the third character means

573
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:51,000
above and the fourth character means

574
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:52,960
Char as you can see in the first example

575
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,558
the one radical is also a conji

576
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,360
character on its own the second coni is

577
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:59,678
actually a reduction of another conji

578
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,399
meaning leaf the leaves and branches

579
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,200
that grow on top of the tree are thought

580
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,759
to represent a different age or a

581
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,240
generation of leaves and branches the

582
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:10,839
war REO here unifies the leaves and

583
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,400
branches from a generation the meaning

584
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:17,558
of this kanji can be interpreted as word

585
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,120
or UK the third kanji is an idiogram

586
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:22,119
which shows the concept of up or above

587
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:25,199
by having one horizontal line above

588
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:27,000
another the fourth conji is a pictogram

589
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,000
the top portion represents the baby's

590
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,359
head while the lower portion represents

591
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,159
its body wrapped in a blanket the one

592
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:37,359
radical here signifies the baby's arm

593
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:41,240
spreading while growing into a child so

594
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,240
the meaning of this kanji is

595
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:47,798
child the one radical appears in many

596
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,640
different positions it commonly sits in

597
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:54,879
the crown position like in thei for word

598
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:57,759
or era another common position is at the

599
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,320
bottom in the foot position as seen in

600
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:02,038
the k for

601
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:04,278
above okay now let's learn how to write

602
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:04,278
this

603
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:12,000
radical the one radical is incredibly

604
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:14,200
simple to write it has only one stroke

605
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,038
the concept of one is represented by a

606
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,960
single stroke that goes from left to

607
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:22,398
right it's important to note that this

608
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,159
horizontal stroke Rises ever so slightly

609
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:28,839
as it approaches the right side and

610
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:28,840
that's it you're done

611
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:34,278
when the one radical is on its own the

612
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:39,558
Kani can be read

613
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:42,038
as for the own reading and for the

614
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:44,398
reading when the one radical is part of

615
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:44,398
another

616
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:49,119
conji for the world or Epoch

617
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,079
coni for the conji meaning above

618
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,240
and for the child conji

619
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:04,759
in this lesson you learned about the one

620
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:06,559
radical the one radical looks like a

621
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:09,079
single horizontal stroke and it

622
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:11,720
signifies the concept of one you also

623
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:14,278
learn the Kani characters for one world

624
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,558
or Epoch above and child in which this

625
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:18,720
radical appears it's most commonly found

626
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,440
in the crown or bottom position and it's

627
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,839
written with just one horizontal stroke

628
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,480
going from left to right hi everyone

629
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:26,639
welcome to the Japanese kanji video

630
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,670
series in this lesson you'll learn the

631
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,769
word radical

632
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,769
[Music]

633
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,360
take a look at these kanji characters

634
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,759
can you guess what they

635
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,558
mean by the end of this lesson you'll be

636
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,038
able to grasp the meaning behind these

637
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:43,480
Kani characters first off can you spot

638
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:44,919
the radical that's common in all of

639
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,679
these kanji

640
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:51,360
characters it's this part here this

641
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,919
particular radical is called G the word

642
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,079
radical is used in some of the most

643
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:58,840
common kanji characters let's take a

644
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:58,839
look at it in more detail

645
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:05,600
the meaning for the word radical relates

646
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:08,519
to words or speech from left to right

647
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:11,519
the first Ki means to say the second

648
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:13,839
means to talk or Story the third

649
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,319
character means language and the fourth

650
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,678
character means plan as you can see in

651
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:21,439
the first example the word radical is a

652
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:23,759
coni character on its own did you spot

653
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,679
the smaller mous laico that we learned

654
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:30,440
in lesson six it's this part here the

655
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:33,798
other part above it it's actually the

656
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,798
heart radical the heart sparing from the

657
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:40,158
mouth is symbolic of

658
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:43,839
wordss or meaning to say you can imagine

659
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:46,039
the lines as words exiting the mouse the

660
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,879
second kanji has the word radical on the

661
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:50,599
left and this other character on the

662
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,159
right once again there's the small mouth

663
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:53,839
radical that we learned sitting at the

664
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,399
bottom there can you guess what the

665
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,558
radical on the right

666
00:27:55,398 --> 00:28:00,038
is I'll give you a clue it's a physical

667
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,519
muscle in your

668
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:04,798
body the large radical on the right

669
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:06,519
represents the tongue here's the mouth

670
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:09,359
on the bottom and there's the tongue

671
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:11,720
sticking out of it do you see it now the

672
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:15,599
word radical paired with the tongue

673
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,720
radical gives you the Ki meaning to talk

674
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,639
the third kanji has the word radical on

675
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,759
the left and this other radical on the

676
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,440
right and guess what there's that mouth

677
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:27,839
radical again there's this other tiny

678
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:30,640
character above the mouth it means five

679
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:32,720
but y five it's traditionally thought

680
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,038
that we experience language through five

681
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,558
paths using our two eyes two ears and

682
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:39,798
our mouth which adds up to five together

683
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:42,440
this character stands for language the

684
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:45,000
fource kji is the word radical paired

685
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,519
with the 10 radical which we learned in

686
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,919
lesson five think for a moment and guess

687
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,319
what it might

688
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:56,120
mean remember the radical on the right

689
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:59,839
can mean 10 but it can also mean

690
00:28:56,119 --> 00:29:02,439
complete the meaning of this kind is to

691
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,720
PL words thought to completion means

692
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,519
that something has been planned out

693
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,038
we've only learned six radicals so far

694
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:09,640
in this series but are you starting to

695
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:11,079
see how we can already break down and

696
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,000
guess the meanings of many coni

697
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:15,519
characters imagine what you could do if

698
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,359
you just learned a few more radicals

699
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,359
okay let's move

700
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:24,960
on the word radical will almost always

701
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:28,639
be in the left position as seen in the

702
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,159
original examples for talk language and

703
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,919
plan notice how the word radical is

704
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:33,960
squished horizontally when it's in the

705
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:36,640
left

706
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:39,079
position okay now let's learn how to

707
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,080
write this

708
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,640
radical the word radical is written in

709
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:47,679
seven strokes the first stroke is a

710
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,519
diagonal stroke that starts at the top

711
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,759
and goes from left to right the second

712
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:55,278
stroke is a long and flat horizontal

713
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:57,558
stroke which also goes from left to

714
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:58,839
right and sits just under the first

715
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:00,240
stroke

716
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:03,000
the third and fourth Strokes are

717
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,558
identical to the previous stroke except

718
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,240
shorter the last section is a box which

719
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:11,720
sits at the bottom it's written in the

720
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,399
same way as the mouse laico that we

721
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,159
learned in lesson six so the fifth

722
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:18,599
stroke is a vertical stroke that goes

723
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,200
from top to bottom on the left side the

724
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:23,158
sixth stroke goes from left to right

725
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,519
bends and continues

726
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:28,278
downwards the seventh and final stroke

727
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:31,000
closes the box at the bottom and that's

728
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:31,000
it you're

729
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:36,360
done when the word radical is on its own

730
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:42,359
the kanji can be read

731
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:46,119
as for the reading and E for the reading

732
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:49,879
when the word radical is part of another

733
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:49,879
conji for the talk

734
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:59,880
conji for the language conji and

735
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,879
K for the plan conji

736
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,840
in this lesson you learned about the

737
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:06,359
word radical it signifies word or speech

738
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:09,240

00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:56,359
of this character is bright the next

782
00:32:54,278 --> 00:32:57,679
kanji has the day radical on the left

783
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:59,759

projected which is the meaning of this

796
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:29,759
kanji okay let's move on

797
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:35,360
the day radical will usually appear in

798
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:39,079
the left position as seen in the

799
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:42,359
original examples will bright time and

800
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:44,079
reflect or project when the day radical

801
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:47,359
is part of another kanji character it

802
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:50,079
shrinks in size okay now let's learn how

803
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,079
to write this

804
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:56,919
radical the day retical is written in

805
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:58,918
four strokes the first stroke is a

806
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:01,240
vertical stroke starts on the left and

807
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,919
goes from top to bottom the second

808
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:06,278
stroke is a toe right hand corner it

809
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,159
connects with the first stroke and goes

810
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:11,440
left to right bends and then goes

811
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:13,079
straight down the third stroke is a

812
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,599
horizontal stroke that occurs at the

813
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:18,399
halfway point and goes left to right the

814
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,760
fourth and final stroke is a horizontal

815
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:23,960
stroke closing out the box and that's it

816
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,960
you're

817
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:29,000
done when the day radical is AI on its

818
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,320
own it it can be read

819
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,679
as for the reading and he for the

820
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,480
reading and when the day radical is part

821
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:42,280
of another conji

822
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,280
May for the bright

823
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:51,320
conji for the time coni and

824
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,319
a for the reflect or project

825
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,399
conji in this lesson you learned about

826
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,519
the day radical the day radical looks

827

day you also learn the coni characters

829
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,920
for sun or day bright time and reflect

830
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,079
or project in which this radical appears

831
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,880
it usually appears in the left position

832
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:12,880
and it's written with four strokes one

833
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,200

00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:23,199
movement

838
00:35:20,929 --> 00:35:25,358
[Music]

839
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:28,480
radical take a look at these kanji

840
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:30,199
characters can you guess what they mean

by the end of this lesson you'll be able

842
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:34,639
to grasp the meaning behind these kanji

843
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,079
characters first off can you spot the

844
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:37,719
radical that's common in all of these

845
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,480
coni

846
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:44,000
characters it's this part here this

847
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,760
particular radical is called sh the

848
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,159
movement radical is used in some of the

849
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,040
most common kanji characters let's take

850
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,039
a look at it in more

851
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,318
detail the meaning behind this radical

852
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,440
is movement or path this radical doesn't

853
00:35:57,318 --> 00:36:02,079
exist on its own so you'll only find it

854
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,720
in other kji characters from left to

855
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,720
right the first kji means near the

856
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:10,039
second means to R the third character

857
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:12,759
means weak and the fourth character

858
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:14,039
means to carry the first kanji has the

859
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,800
movement radical in the bottom

860
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:18,119
surrounding position and the portion

861
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,760
above it is the character for axe the

862
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:22,280
function of an axe is essentially to

863
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,359
chop things and to make them smaller so

864
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,839
together a small movement can mean that

865
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:30,000
something is nearby so the meaning of

866
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:32,639
this character is close or

867
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,159
nearby the second kanji has the movement

868
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,078
radical in the bottom surrounding

869
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:38,838
position again and the portion above it

870
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,880
is the character for reverse or oppose

871
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:44,759
reverse movement means to return so this

872
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,720
kji means to return the third conji has

873
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,040
the radical in the same position but

874
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:49,759
this time with the character for

875
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:52,119
circumference movement around a

876
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,119
circumference alludes to a cycle this

877
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:58,240
particular kji is used to signify the

878
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,640
cycle of the week the final II has the

879
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:01,919
movement radical paired with the

880
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:04,559
character for Army a moving Army

881
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,760
transports weapons foods and goods

882
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:12,559
therefore the meaning of this kanji is

883
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:12,560
to transport or to carry okay let's move

884
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:18,400
on the movement radical will always be

885
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:21,119
in the bottom surrounding position and

886
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,599
because of this it's easily recognizable

887
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:28,240
s can be seen in the original examples

888
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:32,079
for near to return weak and to carry

889
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:32,078
okay now let's learn how to write this

890
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:38,679
radicle the movement reticle is written

891
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:40,599
in three Strokes the first stroke is a

892
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:42,598
short diagonal stroke that starts on the

893
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:44,960
left it goes from left to the bottom

894
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:48,200
right the second stroke looks like a

895
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:51,599
zigzag it starts below the first stroke

896
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:55,078
and goes left to right B going downwards

897
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,280
slightly and then repeat ensure that you

898
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,960
write the second stroke in one smooth

899
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,800
mod motion the third and final stroke is

900
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,960
a slightly curved horizontal stroke

901
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,480
which connects to the previous stroke it

902
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,920
starts from the left and goes all the

903
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:12,719
way to the right and that's it you're

904
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,639
done the movement radical isn't a kanji

905
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,799
character on its own so it'll only

906
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:19,879
appear as part of another conji when it

907
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,880
does it can be read as

908
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:25,039
follows for the coni meaning close or

909
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:29,440
nearby

910
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,440
H for the conji meaning return

911
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,480
for the conji meaning weak

912
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:38,719
and for the conji meaning to transport

913
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,719
or

914
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,760
carry in this lesson you learned about

915
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,200
the movement radical the concept behind

916
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,760
the character is movement or path you

917
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:51,039
also learn the kanji characters for

918
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,319
close return weak and transport or carry

919
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:55,000
in which this radical appears it'll

920
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:56,639
always appear in the bottom surrounding

921
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
position and it's written with three

922
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,559
Strokes a diagonal stroke a zigzag

923
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,039
looking stroke and a long curved

924
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:05,400

00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,400
lesson you'll learn the gate

927
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:12,559
[Music]

928
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,318
radical take a look at these kanji

929
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:16,960
characters can you guess what they mean

930
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:18,960
by the end of this lesson you'll be able

931
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,240
to grasp the meaning behind these kanji

932
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,760
characters first off can you spot the

933
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:23,919
radical that's common in all of these

934
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,640
kanji

935
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,599
characters it's this part here it looks

936
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:32,039
like a gate or window with two sliding

937
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:34,440
doors this particular radical is

938
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:37,000
called the gate radical is used in some

939
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:40,079
of the most common Kani characters let's

940
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,079
take a look at it in more

941
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:47,039
detail the concept behind this radical

942
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:50,000
is gate division or Department from left

943
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:52,519
to right the first Ki means gate the

944
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,960
second means period the third character

945
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:57,800
means question and the fourth character

946
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,920
means to listen the first EX example

947
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:03,160
shows that this radical exists as a

948
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,960
kanji Cala on its own the second kanji

949
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:06,759
has the gate radical in the enclosing

950
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,838
position and this other character in the

951
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,440
center it's the day radical that we

952
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:14,440
learned in lesson 9 the concept of the

953
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,318
gate radical together with day gives us

954
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:20,358
a division of Z which we can associate

955
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:22,159
with a period of time the third kanji

956
00:40:20,358 --> 00:40:23,799
has the same radical paired with another

957
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:25,440
character that we've learned it's the

958
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,800
mouth radical that we learned in lesson

959
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,960
six the department of of mouth means to

960
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,680
question or to ask the final kanji has

961
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,358
the same radical paired with another

962
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:39,000
character which is the kanji character

963
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:42,880
for ear the department of ear means to

964
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,880
lesson okay let's move

965
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:48,880
on the gate radical will always appear

966
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,400
in the enclosing position whether it's

967
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,318
by itself or if it's used in other coni

968
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,000
characters and because of this it's

969
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:59,000
easily recognizable as seen in the

970
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,358
original examples for gate period

971
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,318
question and to listen it will always be

972
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:05,880
in this

973
00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:08,279
position okay now let's learn how to

974
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,280
write this

975
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:14,559
radical the gate radical is written in

976
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:16,559
eight Strokes the first stroke is a

977
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:19,279
straight vertical downstroke on the left

978
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:21,759
side the second stroke looks like a

979
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,920
right corner it connects to the fast

980
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:27,480
stroke and goes from left to right bends

981
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,119
and continues downward slightly the

982
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,920
third and fourth Strokes are two

983
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,200
horizontal Strokes that close out the

984
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:36,760
box the fifth stroke is a short vertical

985
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:39,399
stroke which starts near the center and

986
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,599
goes downward slightly the sixth stroke

987
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,000
connects to the previous stroke it goes

988
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,039
from left to right bends and continues

989
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,719
all the way downwards reaching the floor

990
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:50,199
where it flicks upward slightly towards

991
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:52,679
the center the last two strokes are

992
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:57,639
horizontal Strokes that close out the

993
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:57,639
books and that's it you're done

994
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,760
when the gate radical appears on its own

995
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:08,318
the coni character can be read as Mo for

996
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:12,240
the own reading and for the reading when

997
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,239
the gate radical is part of another

998
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,119
conji for the coni meaning

999
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:23,239
period for the conji meaning ask or

1000
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:23,239
question

1001
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,639
and for the conji meaning listen

in this lesson you learned about the

1003
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:35,200
gate radical the concept behind the

1004
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:36,960
character is gate division or Department

1005
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:40,078
you also learn the Kani characters for

1006
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,159
gate period ask or question and listen

in which this radical appears this

1008
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:45,480
radical will always be in the enclosing

1009
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,480
position and it's written in eight

1010
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:50,119
