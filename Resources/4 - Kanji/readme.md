# Kanji
Kanji are logographic characters originating from China that are used in the Japanese writing system alongside the phonetic scripts hiragana and katakana. Each kanji character represents a meaning or an idea, and they are primarily used for nouns, verb stems, and adjective stems. While there are tens of thousands of kanji, the Jōyō kanji set of about 2,136 characters is considered the everyday core used in Japanese.

**Kanji composition**
To someone who hasn't started learning Japanese yet, kanji may look like blobs of random scribbles. Thankfully, in reality each kanji is just a composition of either simpler kanji or primitive components called radicals. For example, 曇 is a combination of 日, 雨 and 云. There are only about 200 of such basic components.

This property of kanji can be and often used to aid memorization. Many kanji study methods exploit kanji composition and teach kanji in terms of their parts. Being able to see kanji in terms of their components makes learning words easier.

**Types of readings**
Usually, a kanji has one or more Chinese-derived readings (音読み, on-yomi) and one or more native Japanese readings (訓読み, kun-yomi). Occasionally, a kanji may have only kun-yomi or only on-yomi readings.

Kun-yomi readings are the native Japanese readings of kanji characters. These readings are typically used when a kanji character appears as part of a standalone word or in combination with hiragana characters. Verbs like 逃げる (にげる), adjectives like 苦い (にがい), or standalone-kanji words like 肉 (にく) are pronounced using Japanese readings.

On-yomi readings are borrowed readings from the Chinese language. When kanji characters were introduced to Japan from China, they brought along their Chinese pronunciation, which became known as on-yomi. On-yomi readings are often used in compound words, especially in formal or technical contexts. Compound words such as 特定, 原案, 脂肪 are read using Chinese readings.

Understanding this trait of kanji will help you learn new words. If you see a kanji on its own (e.g. 木), it is likely pronounced with a Japanese reading. Likewise, if you see a kanji compound (e.g. 綺麗), it's safe to assume that the kanji within the word are pronounced using Chinese readings.

**Kanji sounds**
The more words you learn, the easier it becomes to learn new ones. While each kanji character may have multiple readings, there are patterns that you start to notice as you grow your vocabulary.

For example:

Learning the word 人生 makes learning 生活 easier, as both share the character 生 pronounced as せい.
Similarly, learning the word 会社 can help memorize 会議, given their common 会 character pronounced as かい.

**Kanji fluency**

Jumping right into learning words in the beginning is not easy. Similar characters often look the same and remembering words takes many repetitions. You have to somehow force the words into your brain and there are no mental anchors to help you. However, if you do this enough, eventually you arrive at the point when kanji stop being foreign anymore. Once you reach this point, your brain starts to recognize each kanji as a whole without paying attention to its component parts. You start distinguishing them easily from each other, and learning new kanji becomes effortless. This point is called kanji fluency.

When you reach kanji fluency, recognizing a kanji becomes just like recognizing someone's face. It takes an instant to remember the face of a person. Later if you just look at the person again you immediately know if you've met them before even if you might forget their name or why you know them.

With kanji, you're not analyzing the component parts but taking the whole character as one unit. When you see a new kanji, it will look like something to you. When you encounter that character again, you will instantly recognize it as the same exact character.

In other words, if you wanted to test whether you have kanji fluency, you could do this experiment.

Randomly select one kanji that you have never seen before in your life, look at it. Example: 賃.
Wait a couple of days.
Take a number of randomly selected kanji that you have also never seen before. The kanji you saw in step 1 can be among them. Example: 責 魔 歓 賃 脅. Ask yourself, "which of these kanji is the one I saw a couple of days ago?"
Guess if the kanji you saw in step 1 happens to be among the others.
If you could easily pass the test then that means you have kanji fluency. It means just by looking at a kanji you can remember it. Maybe you don't remember its exact strokes, maybe you don't remember its readings, maybe you don't remember its meanings, but you can still tell characters apart and recall which kanji you saw the other day. Of course, you don't have to do this test. It's just an imaginary algorithm that demonstrates what kanji fluency is.
