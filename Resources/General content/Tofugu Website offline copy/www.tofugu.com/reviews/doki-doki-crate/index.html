<p>Back when we started <a href="../japan-crate/index.html">our review of the Japan Crate candy box</a>, we saw the same company was launching a sister box called Doki Doki Crate. This new subscription box promised monthly deliveries of "kawaii items." But what do they mean by "items?" A candy box is self-explanatory. "Items" can be almost anything!</p>

<p>To find out, we hit subscribe and let the pink boxes roll in for six months. We unboxed them all at once, examined each item, and started our mega-review of the Doki Doki Crate service. We're going to show you exactly what came in each box and tell you if it's worth your hard-earned money.</p>

<p><strong>Note to the reader:</strong> Tofugu was not paid to do this Doki Doki Crate review. Nor were we given free boxes. We paid for these boxes using our own money and your <a href="https://www.wanikani.com/?utm_source=tofugu&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=Doki%20Doki%20Crate">WaniKani</a> subscription payments. This way we could be sure we were getting the same service as everybody else.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-doki-doki-crate">What is Doki Doki Crate?</h2>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="pink subscription box on table" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/reviews/2016-08-23-doki-doki-crate/doki-doki-crate.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Doki Doki Crate is a monthly subscription box of kawaii toys, items, and accessories. You pay a fee to have packages of curated items sent to you. Right now, there is only one size and purchase option:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$30/mo</li>
  <li>½ pound</li>
  <li>8-10 items</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from these three points, nothing is guaranteed. Items can be anything "kawaii," from plushes to keychains to kitchen utensils. If the box curators consider it cute, it could be sent out in a Doki Doki box.</p>

<p>If you haven't guessed by now, the target audience for this box is fans of Japan's kawaii culture. Though "<a href="../../japan/otaku-meaning/index.html">otaku</a>" goods may occasionally be included, don't count on many Naruto figures.</p>

<p>Payment options can be monthly or prepaid in 3, 6, or 12-month installments. The price per box drops slightly the longer your subscription term.</p>

<p><a href="../japan-crate/index.html">As I said in our Japan Crate review</a>, shipping with this service is free anywhere in the U.S., including territories. Shipping outside the U.S. is extra. If you live in <a href="http://help.japancrate.com/hc/en-us/articles/202884655-What-countries-do-you-ship-to-">one of the sixteen countries they don't ship to</a>, you can stop reading now.</p>

<p>Besides the kawaii items you paid for, you also get an <em>interesting</em> perk (if you can call it that). All Doki Doki Crate subscribers are entered to win a "Suteki Crate" each month. It's a mega box filled with premium items like blankets, wallets, purses, game consoles, folders, make-up kits, robes, big plushes, and deluxe figures.</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-right">
  <p>In less than a year, Doki Doki Crate has managed to become one of the top kawaii subscription boxes on the market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your chances of winning one of these is like winning the lottery. So what they're offering is more like a monthly sense of longing and jealousy. But it’s a nice <em>actual</em> perk if you’re ever lucky enough to win.</p>

<p>During its short life, Doki Doki Crate has already managed to become one of the top kawaii subscription boxes out there (there are about 20 <a href="../kawaii-box/index.html">others</a> on the market as of this writing). But does Doki Doki deserve this success, or is it just beginner's luck? Get ready to feast your eyes on six piles of cuteness, followed by our thoughts and final verdict.</p>

<h3 id="box-1---december-2015">Box 1 - December 2015</h3>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="pink box filled with toys" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/reviews/2016-08-23-doki-doki-crate/doki-doki-december-crate.jpg" /></figure>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Estimated Value:</strong> $12.67</p>

  <p><strong>Weight:</strong> 1.24lb</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we first unboxed this crate, we were excited by how many character goods were in it. But on closer inspection, it was evident how Japan Crate was able to afford so many items with popular characters: they’re all bootlegs.</p>

<p><strong>Hello Kitty Blind Box:</strong></p>

<figure class="figure-right"><img alt="bootleg hello kitty figure" style="width: 200px;" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/reviews/2016-08-23-doki-doki-crate/hello-kitty.jpg" /></figure>

<p>This is a nice figurine. Nice, but not outstanding. Like the other character goods in the December box, this is not an official product.</p>

<p>This figure is good for a knock-off. The sculpt is accurate. None of the features are out of place. But the paint on the hat is muddy around the edges, and there are excess globs on the top and bill. <a href="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/reviews/2016-08-23-doki-doki-crate/headless-hello-kitty.jpg">The head of our Kitty fell off because of weak glue</a>, but we stuck it back on, and it stays fine. At a distance, this figure looks great. Being a statuette with no articulation, the problems mentioned above aren't deal-breakers. But if you’re a collector only interested in official merchandise, this will be an unwelcome gift.</p>

<p>This box introduces us to Hoppe-chan, a character that’s popular with elementary school students in Japan. At first, I couldn't believe this cheapie blob was popular, but <a href="http://www.sanrio.co.jp/corporate/release/y2014/d0129/">further investigation proved it to be true</a>. There’s a Hoppe-chan 3DS game, and it's even in cahoots with Hello Kitty. So if you’re interested in getting something that’s hot in Japan, Hoppe-chan is it. For now.</p>

<p>Take note: all character goods in this box are knock-offs, with the exception of Hoppe-chan and Alpacasso.</p>

<p><strong>Sailor Moon Blind Box:</strong></p>

<p>This Sailor Moon toy, like December’s Hello Kitty figurine, is not an official product. It's a knockoff of <a href="http://www.sailormooncollectibles.com/2015/11/29/sailor-saturn-chibimoon-petit-chara-deluxe-figures/">this figure from MegaHouse</a>. The same pros and cons associated with the Hello Kitty figure are applied here.</p>

<p>That said, the paint job on this figure is much worse. Sitting on a desk, it will look fine. But closer examination exposes a handful of tiny flaws. Also, <a href="http://files.tofugu.com/articles/reviews/2016-08-23-doki-doki-crate/luna-p.jpg">the tiny, loose Luna P head</a> is missing the deely-bop like in the original.</p>

<p><strong>Chi's Sweet Home Blind Box:</strong></p>

<p>For a knock-off, this is neat. When you pull the string on its head, its eyes pop out and the tail moves.</p>

<p>Visually it's nearly perfect. I have no complaints on the sculpt or paint. It's the best-looking unofficial toy we got.</p>

<p>But a small issue is the moving parts. The eyes and tail move only slightly. I can't know for sure without seeing an "official" version of this toy, but it feels like the parts should be more animated than they are. It's as if something's holding them back.</p>

<p><strong>Cardcaptor Sakura Blind Box:</strong></p>

<figure class="figure-right"><img alt="bootleg figure of cardcaptor sakura" style="width: 200px;" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/reviews/2016-08-23-doki-doki-crate/cardcaptor-sakura.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Lots for Cardcaptor fans this month. This blind box offers Sakura in 1 of 6 outfits. And it comes with a little Kero companion.</p>

<p>Like the others, it looks good for a bootleg. The paint is fine everywhere except the gloves and the wand. The wand is especially sloppy.</p>

<p>The clear plastic arms that keep Sakura in place are ungodly difficult to snap in. I was worried about breaking the toy before getting a chance to take pictures. It took about ten minutes of careful work to put it together.</p>

<p>This is where Doki Doki Crate turns a corner. No more knock-offs. But this means fewer character goods going forward.</p>

<p>I must admit, at the initial unboxing of all six, this shift was a disappointment. But when I started looking at the items in detail, I changed my opinion. The quality and variety of Doki Doki Crate goes up with this box, and they stop trying to make everything character-centric.</p>

<p>This is also the beginning of Japan Crate making their own items to put in the boxes, something I feel separates them from other kawaii Subscription boxes.</p>

<p>At first I thought, "Rubber bands? Really?" But over time, I started to see how this could be neat.</p>

<p>Charmy Loom is a small loom used to make bracelets and other accessories with rubber bands. Since part of Doki Doki Crate's customer base is parents ordering the box for their kids, it’s nice that the company offers activities, rather than just another trinket.</p>

<p>Your feelings about Charmy Loom will depend on who you are. If you’re a busy grown-up human, you probably won’t have much use for it. But if you’re younger or like cute DIY projects, then it will be a welcome gift.</p>

<p>This is a great item. Official character merchandise and <i>kikangentei</i> <ruby>期間限定<rp>（</rp><rt>きかんげんてい</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby> (limited time only). It comes from Hello Kitty and Doraemon’s recent collaboration. The goods aren’t easily available outside of Japan, so this item is cool.</p>

<p>Though the quantity of Doki Doki Crate has gone down since the initial box, the quality has gone up. And this coin purse a great example of that.</p>

<p><strong>Petite Lapin Plush</strong></p>

<figure class="figure-right"><img alt="dog that looks like a pastry plush" style="width: 200px;" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/reviews/2016-08-23-doki-doki-crate/petite-lapin-plush.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Petite Lapin might be the crowning achievement of all six boxes, philosophically speaking. Not only is it a cute plush, but the character is also exclusive to Doki Doki Crate. It's evidence Doki Doki Crate is on the right track after a shaky start.</p>

<p>Petite Lapin is a good quality plush. No loose strings or wonky stitching. The design is simple and easy to love. The backstory is heavy on stupid details and vague on important information, like a good kyara backstory should be.</p>

<p>Your reaction to this will depend on what you’re interested in. If you want established characters from familiar franchises, this is an unwanted new direction. But if you want new kawaii merch you can't find anywhere else, Petite Lapin is the kawaii medicine you’ve been waiting for.</p>

<h2 id="doki-doki-crate-judgment">Doki Doki Crate Judgment</h2>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="side art of doki doki crate" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/reviews/2016-08-23-doki-doki-crate/doki-doki-side.jpg" /></figure>

<p>After examining each kawaii item individually, it's time to let the hammer drop. This is where the Doki Doki Crate review gets perspective.</p>

<p>Let's look at the six boxes overall. This will help you know what to expect if you subscribe.</p>

<p>We judged the crates on five criteria:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Variety</li>
  <li>Uniqueness</li>
  <li>Presentation</li>
  <li>Quality</li>
  <li>Value</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s begin with Variety.</p>

<h3 id="variety">Variety</h3>

<figure class="figure-right"><img alt="package of japanese erasers shaped like food" style="width: 250px;" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/reviews/2016-08-23-doki-doki-crate/japanese-erasers.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Doki Doki Crate scored well in the Variety category. This is easy when the only criteria for crate items is "kawaii." Anything can be kawaii, so you shouldn't shouldn't see the same items twice (if you do, Japan Crate isn't being creative). That being said, there wasn't much <a href="../../japan/kimokawaii/index.html">kimokawaii</a>
 to speak of.</p>

<p>In general, items included in Doki Doki Crate were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plushes</li>
  <li>Clothing</li>
  <li>Accessories</li>
  <li>Jewelry</li>
  <li>Stationery</li>
  <li>Figures</li>
  <li>Stickers</li>
  <li>Pens</li>
  <li>Charms</li>
  <li>Kitchen goods</li>
  <li>Activity Kits</li>
</ul>

<p>This wide variety is Doki Doki Crate’s strength and weakness. With cute items, a subscriber’s personal taste in fashion, anime, and aesthetics factor heavily into their enjoyment of the box. <a href="../../japan/kawaii/index.html">What someone finds "cute" is subjective</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-left">
  <p>With cute items, a subscriber’s taste in fashion, anime, and aesthetics factor heavily into their enjoyment of a box.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, character goods are a hard target to hit. A <em>Cardcaptor Sakura</em> figure can only thrill a fan of the series. I’ve never seen the show, so my reaction will be less electric than someone who is familiar with it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it’s risky for them to include only generic items like the animal plushes. Sure, I like the alpaca plush. But would I like it as much as a plush from a series I’m attached to? When the items are general, you sacrifice the high excitement a particular character can bring. But that specific character hits a narrower audience. This is a tricky balance for Doki Doki Crate to pull off.</p>

<h3 id="uniqueness">Uniqueness</h3>

<figure class="figure-right"><img alt="hoppe-chan blob with eyes" style="width: 250px;" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/reviews/2016-08-23-doki-doki-crate/hoppe-chan-chain.jpg" /></figure>

<p>The total for this Doki Doki Crate review goes up because of points scored in the Uniqueness category.</p>

<p>The reason: exclusive items. One way they achieve this is through partnerships and collaborations with companies like Sunhoseki.</p>

<p>But the real achievement in uniqueness is Japan Crate’s development of exclusive characters and merch. Beginning in March, Doki Doki Crate included stickers from their in-house artist. They followed this up with the Petite Lapin plush in May.</p>

<p>This is important because inclusion of unique items shows that Doki Doki wants to establish itself as a kawaii brand, rather than just a box full of other people's stuff. Plushes especially are hard to produce. So the addition of Petite Lapin proves to me that they're committed to this idea.</p>

<h3 id="presentation">Presentation</h3>

<figure class="figure-right"><img alt="manga in doki doki crate zine" style="width: 250px;" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/reviews/2016-08-23-doki-doki-crate/doki-doki-crate-manga.jpg" /></figure>

<p>The presentation of Doki Doki Crate is fine. There is tissue paper inside each box. Everything inside is packed properly. The only thing that arrived slightly damaged was the box for the <em>Cardcaptor Sakura</em> figure (the item itself wasn't damaged).</p>

<p>The Doki Doki boxes have a bright pink base color with artwork printed in white. The outer packaging art features a label on the top, a message on the front, cute character drawings on the back, and an allover print on the inside. Keeping the outside stark and the inside busy makes the contents feel more fun. It’s a neat design choice that supports the unboxing experience.</p>

<p>The six-page pack-in zine is thin. As a new service, this is to be expected. The zine is devoted to describing items in the box, advertising the Suteki crate, showing off subscriber fan pictures, and presenting <i><abbr title="A four-panel comic strip, usually humorous.">4-koma</abbr></i> <ruby>４コマ<rp>（</rp><rt></rt><rp>）</rp></ruby> manga.</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-left">
  <p>Keeping the outside stark and the inside busy makes the contents feel more fun and supports the unboxing experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cover of each zine is done by a different artist. This gives the covers a unique flavor month to month, and exposes the subscriber's to new art styles. This is a sign Japan Crate knows its audience.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="A four-panel comic strip, usually humorous.">4-koma</abbr> manga in the zines is cute. The humor hits the mark about half the time, which bothers me more than it should. I think because the character designs and art are so well done, I want the writing to be better. Also, the zine is only six pages, so I feel it's important the one entertainment piece be <em>actually</em> entertaining. That said, I liked these comics much more than <a href="../japan-crate/index.html">those offered in Japan Crate's zines</a>.</p>

<h3 id="quality">Quality</h3>

<figure class="figure-right"><img alt="box art of characters opening a box" style="width: 250px;" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/reviews/2016-08-23-doki-doki-crate/enjoy-art.jpg" /></figure>

<p>The service is on the straight and narrow now, but the first three boxes of knock-off goods hurt the overall quality score for this Doki Doki Crate review.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://twitter.com/Bootleg_Stuff/status/754593243480719360">considering how bad bootlegs can get</a>, these aren't bad at all. I couldn't tell they were unofficial at first glance. But I noticed on the second glance.</p>

<p>That's why I find it hard to believe <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-02-14/japan-crate-doki-doki-crate-ships-with-bootleg-items-company-responds/.98557">Japan Crate didn't know the products were bootleg</a>. I figured it out after two days. It took them <em>three months</em>.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, the era of knock-offs is over. It shouldn't be an issue for subscribers going forward. But the removal of bootlegs means fewer character goods overall, and more generally kawaii items that don't carry the steep price tag of Sanrio or Ghibli licenses.</p>

<p>This is the most important category. Getting this box means spending money. Your money. Is Doki Doki Crate worth it?</p>

<p>To find out, we weighed the items from each crate to get an average. We also got dollar value estimates for each item, combined them, and found the average.</p>

<p>Please note estimating value for these crates isn't easy, and maybe not entirely accurate. We don't know which items Japan Crate buys in bulk, or if they have special agreements with goods manufacturers. Also, these numbers don't include taxes or shipping. That said, our estimate should give you a rough idea of the value you get as a subscriber.</p>

<p>First, the averages per box:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Average Item Weight Per Box: 0.70lb (0.3kg)</li>
  <li>Average Dollar Value Estimate Per Box: $12.77 (USD)</li>
</ul>

<p>You spend $30 and get $12.77 worth of items. That's doesn't seem like a lot. But this estimate doesn't include shipping or taxes.</p>

<p>The price Japan Crate has to pay to send you these items is likely higher than our average. So the question is, do you like the items they pick out and are the extra fees worth the surprise of opening the box each month?</p>

<h2 id="doki-doki-crate-review-verdict">Doki Doki Crate Review Verdict</h2>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="corner of doki doki crate packaging" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/reviews/2016-08-23-doki-doki-crate/love-art.jpg" /></figure>

<p><a href="../japan-crate/index.html">With the candy box review</a>, it was easy to give a hearty recommendation (everyone loves candy). But Doki Doki Crate is a different beast.</p>

<p>The appeal of objects, especially cute ones, has more to do with personal taste and style. And the service is less than a year old. Anyone subscribing now is likely to experience experimental changes over the course of a year (<a href="http://japancrate.wpengine.com/?p=1232">hope you like T-shirts</a>). But the sea of change in focus over the course of our six boxes seems to indicate the service is headed in the right direction.</p>

<p>If you’re in the market for cute goods, Doki Doki Crate is an alright choice. It won’t satisfy super nerds looking for merch from their favorite anime. But if you like the kawaii things in general, Doki Doki Crate delivers just that.</p>

There were only two Sailor Moon items in six months, and one of them was a knockoff. 許せない！ Okay, so it wasn’t that bad, but if I’m going to spend money on a subscription box I want it to be at least 80% things I want. This was more like 10% things I wanted. If there were more plushies and figurines, instead of ugly pieces of paper and plastic foods my cat will eat when I’m not looking, I’d have given this a better rating.</p>

<section class="individual-review"><div class="individual-review__avatar"><a href="../../about/people/koichi/index.html"><img src="../../images/about/people/avatar-koichi-0d7c291b.jpg" alt="Avatar koichi 0d7c291b" /></a></div><div class="individual-review__content"><h3 class="individual-review__title">Koichi’s Review<i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-down" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="Not Recommended "></i><span class="individual-review_rating">3/10</span></h3><p>The goods were cheap. I suppose you probably know that when you are subscribing. But, I would prefer fewer, higher quality things in a box than the easy-to-break-sometimes-knockoff pens, keychains, and figures that they send. At some point, I think all people will reach the point where they are just tired of getting “stuff” and unsubscribe.</p>

<section class="individual-review"><div class="individual-review__avatar"><a href="../../about/people/michael-richey/index.html"><img src="../../images/about/people/avatar-michael-richey-9c293d25.jpg" alt="Avatar michael richey 9c293d25" /></a></div><div class="individual-review__content"><h3 class="individual-review__title">Michael’s Review<i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="Recommended"></i><span class="individual-review_rating">6/10</span></h3><p>Of all of Japan Crate’s boxes, this one was fine. I have mixed feelings because we subscribed at the very beginning, when it was full of knock-offs (a problem they have since fixed). The knock-offs were decent, but still, it was such a mixed bag. If you’re into general cuteness, this might float your boat. If you’re hoping for a specific character like Totoro, you can expect Doki Doki Crate to hit the mark, like 13% of the time. And when it does, you’re getting, like, a Totoro eraser, or something.</p>
