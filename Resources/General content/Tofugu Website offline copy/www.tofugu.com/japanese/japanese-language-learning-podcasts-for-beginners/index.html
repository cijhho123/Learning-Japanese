<p>For those of us studying Japanese, listening can be one of the hardest skills to improve. Like with most things, the only way to improve is through practice; however it's easy to try and jump into some native material and then get discouraged or overwhelmed when you can't understand it. Luckily, there's a lot of Japanese language podcasts out there for learners hoping to improve their listening skills. In fact, maybe too many! How can you know what podcasts are worth your time, or best suited for your needs?</p>

<p>In this article, I've rounded-up 10 of what I think are the best beginner-level podcasts for Japanese learners. I'm sorting the list roughly from the easiest at the top to the most difficult at the bottom, based purely on my experience and impressions. I'm also including a table with helpful information about the podcasts, like what they talk about and how long episodes usually are, as well as if they have one host or multiple, for example. Hopefully this all helps you find just the right podcast for you: one that's interesting enough to keep you listening, while still being well-suited to your current Japanese abilities.</p>

<p>Ready to take your listening skills to the next level? Let's dive in!</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-podcast">What Makes a Good Podcast?</h2>

<p>First, some ground rules. What makes a podcast worth listening to in the first place? For this article, I wanted to focus on listening practice, which I feel is best improved through immersion. That means sticking as closely as possible to only Japanese, though since these podcasts are meant for beginners, many of them will pepper in a translation of a word or phrase in English now and then. Additionally, I did my best to pick podcasts that are either currently active, have a large back-catalog of episodes, or ideally both; nothing worse than finally getting into a podcast only to have it abruptly end.</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-right">
  <p>One of the best ways to stay motivated and diligent with your practice is to find something that interests you, while not being too difficult to turn you away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I did have those criteria in mind while I was searching for podcasts, I wanted to be sure to cast a wide net. After all, one of the best ways to stay motivated and diligent with your practice is to find something that interests you, while not being too difficult to turn you away. Some of these podcasts have specific topics they tend to cover, while others are more scattershot, focusing more on making the Japanese easily-comprehensible rather than covering anything particular in depth. Additionally, there are a ton of different types of podcasts: from shorter ones and longer ones, to monologues and group conversations — and the lengths they go to help Japanese learners varies, too. Some offer transcripts, vocabulary lists, or just try to break down difficult words when they use them, while others are more casual.</p>

<p>If you find a host or a series that clicks with you, stick with it! It's best to dive deeply into something than to bounce around and only scratch the surface.</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-podcast-beginner-friendly">What Makes a Podcast Beginner-Friendly?</h2>

<p>Next, how can we define what it means to be a beginner? This is tricky, of course. In general, these are podcasts that are intended to be accessible to the widest number of people. Thinking in <a href="../what-is-the-jlpt/index.html">JLPT</a> terms, I think beginners usually range from the N5 into the start of the N3 level. These learners are probably working through a beginner textbook like the <a href="http://www.tofugu.com/reviews/genki-textbook">ever-popular Genki series</a>, maybe taking an intro class, and are just starting to get a feel for what the Japanese language has to offer.</p>

<p>Since podcasts focus on listening, you technically don't need to be able to read <a href="http://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana">hiragana</a>, <a href="http://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana">katakana</a>, or any kanji to engage with these items. However, I think learning the kana syllabaries and starting to learn kanji should be the start of anyone's Japanese language learning journey, so don't skip that step! Even more, it'll help a ton with deciphering what the hosts are saying, checking a transcript or vocabulary list, or even just being able to look up words you don't know and read the episode titles.</p>

<p>Additionally, listening practice is just inherently a bit more advanced than something like cracking open the first page of Genki, doing the first three levels of <a href="https://www.wanikani.com?utm_source=tofugu">WaniKani</a>, or otherwise getting your feet wet in Japanese. For listening practice in general, I think using the audio included with a textbook like the Genki series and the dialogues the lessons focus on should be your first step. Or, absolute beginners can get started with something that uses visual cues to help convey information, like the excellent <a href="https://cijapanese.com/">Comprehensible Japanese</a> videos.</p>

<p>That said, I think the first few entries on this list are even easier than the audio from Genki, so even for absolute beginners, it shouldn't be long before you're able to get started with these as well.</p>

<h2 id="absolute-beginners-slowed-speech-and-ample-pauses">Absolute Beginners: Slowed Speech and Ample Pauses</h2>

<p>As I mentioned, these podcasts are suited for beginners, but there are a number of different ways to accomplish that. This first section includes podcasts that take probably the simplest approach: slowing down the speaking speed. <a href="https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/language-speed">Japanese is among the fastest spoken languages in the world</a>, and for beginners just starting to do listening practice, it can be daunting to jump into something they're unable to understand.</p>

<p>With these podcasts, that's not an issue. Whether they pause between words or after particles, or even just slow the pace of each syllable down, even beginners should quickly begin to realize they're able to comprehend, and with that, improve.</p>

<h3 id="slow-japanese-by-mochifika">Slow Japanese by Mochifika</h3>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="slow japanese by mochifika" src="https://files.tofugu.com/japanese-learning-resources-database/slow-japanese-by-mochifika/slow-japanese-by-mochifika.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Slow Japanese by Mochifika is a Japanese podcast aimed at providing even beginners with comprehensible listening practice material. The way it does this is as the name implies — it's very slow! The host, Akari, breaks sentences down into pieces, and pronounces words at a near syllable by syllable pace at times. After starting in September 2021, Mochifika has released episodes at a weekly pace, building a comprehensive library. Additionally, transcripts are offered through the series' website, allowing students an even more comprehensive look at the language.</p>

<p>Episodes tend to be very short, mostly around 5 minutes. This, coupled with the relatively slow release schedule makes it easy to get caught up quickly, but also easy to run out of episodes to listen to. Thankfully, the consistent schedule means you probably won't be waiting for too long. Like many Japanese language podcasts, the topics covered vary, but there's a little something for everyone.</p>

<p>Slow Japanese is a great first step into adding some listening practice to your Japanese study routine, and it's nice that even beginners can listen and comprehend. However, the pace really is slow, and most students will outgrow the content pretty quickly. Additionally, because the pace is so unnatural, it's really only a stepping stone rather than something more evergreen. Still, it’s hard to find a better place for Japanese beginners to get their feet wet in listening comprehension.</p>

Because of the pace, the short episodes, and clear pronunciation from host Akari, I think Slow Japanese is probably the most accessible podcast to even very beginner Japanese learners, without the use of visual cues to aid comprehension. That said, I’m not sure it has much longevity. The pace is so slow and unnatural, I think learners will both get tired of it and move beyond it quickly. Still, this is probably the easiest entry point into listening practice I’ve found, and isn’t a bad way for learners to get their feet wet.</p>

<h3 id="thinking-out-loud-in-japanese">Thinking Out Loud in Japanese</h3>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="thinking out loud in japanese" src="https://files.tofugu.com/japanese-learning-resources-database/thinking-out-loud-in-japanese/thinking-out-loud-in-japanese.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Thinking Out Loud in Japanese is a podcast for Japanese language learners that started in 2021. This podcast is focused on beginners, offering something that almost every student will be able to listen to and enjoy, while also getting some practice in. Episodes are really short, most clocking in under 5 minutes, and uses almost exclusively grammar from the Genki textbook series, which makes it an excellent companion to students studying using them. In addition to the restrained grammar, Mel, the host, also speaks using a clear voice, and slowly, often pausing between words. This makes Thinking Out Loud in Japanese one of the most accessible podcasts for students. Mel is a tutor on iTalki, so they're pretty good about catering to students' needs.</p>

<p>Finally, through Patreon, Mel offers full transcripts, as well as some bonus episodes, if you just can't get enough. If you've wanted to add listening practice to your Japanese study routine, but have found it too intimidating when you try, Thinking Out Loud in Japanese might be just what you're looking for.</p>

Additionally, the vocabulary and grammar is a bit more advanced, while still sticking primarily to items corresponding to Genki 1+2. To me, this is a much more natural and beneficial approach for learners, as pausing after particles almost teaches you how to break down a Japanese sentence, understanding it clause by clause. Where メルのThinking out loud in Japanese lacks a bit for me is the topics, length, and slow release schedule. There’s just not a ton here. Still, I think it’s a great stepping stone for Japanese learners.</p>

<h3 id="sakura-tips">Sakura Tips</h3>

<figure class="figure-left"><img alt="sakura tips" src="https://files.tofugu.com/japanese-learning-resources-database/sakura-tips/sakura-tips.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Sakura Tips is a short, daily podcast for beginner level Japanese language learners looking for some level-appropriate listening practice. The host, Mari, speaks in a very clear voice, and slows down her speech, while not overdoing it so much to make it odd. Instead, the speed strikes a nice balance between comprehensibility and naturalness.</p>

<p>Additionally, the podcast is scripted, which avoids any meandering or time-filler phrases, and the script is available to view on her website, in both Japanese and English. This is great for Japanese learners who want to follow along while they listen, or to simply check that they properly heard or understood something spoken.</p>

<p>The topics vary, but with the short episodes, the focus is constrained and easy to understand. Additionally, because of the daily release schedule,  there’s a huge back-catalog of episodes; both so you won’t easily run out, and that you’re sure to find topics that interest you. Really, for beginners looking to get started with Japanese listening practice, there might be no better place than Sakura Tips.</p>

With the huge number of episodes, clear, well articulated pronunciation, and just-slow-enough speech, Mari’s podcast is really something special. With the added benefit of the transcripts, for beginner level Japanese learners, you can’t go wrong. Personally, I wish the episodes were a little bit longer, so you could settle into the practice a bit more, but with how many episodes are now available, that’s less of an issue. Additionally, it really is a beginner podcast, so it won’t be long before you’re ready to move on. But to my mind, Sakura Tips is about as good as it gets.</p>

<h3 id="japanese-with-shun">Japanese with Shun</h3>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="japanese with shun" src="https://files.tofugu.com/japanese-learning-resources-database/japanese-with-shun/japanese-with-shun.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Japanese with Shun is a Japanese podcast series focused on providing listening practice that’s accessible to beginners. It accomplishes this in a few ways. For one, Shun speaks slowly and clearly, often pausing after particles to give learners a chance to think and parse what they’ve just heard. Secondly, he’s very thoughtful about constraining his speech to use mostly grammar points from the Genki 1 &amp; 2 beginner textbook series, meaning almost any Japanese learner can enjoy.</p>

<p>Shun, like many other Japanese language learning podcasters, is also a Japanese teacher, offering lessons via iTalki, as well as a series of YouTube videos and other related content. For Japanese learners, this lets you know how accustomed he is to teaching.</p>

<p>Episodes are released once-weekly, and most clock in between 5-10 minutes. While this is fairly short, the large back-catalog means you won’t soon run out of episodes to listen to. For beginners looking for a fun, interesting, and level-suited podcast, Japanese with Shun is a great choice.</p>

While there are a ton of beginner-focused Japanese language learning podcasts under 10 minutes, you can tell how much Shun cares about making sure his podcast is well-suited to learners. Additionally, Japanese with Shun strikes a rare balance, where he manages to restrict the grammar and vocabulary, while still covering interesting and nuanced topics and not devolving into childish themes like other similar podcasts.</p>

<h2 id="beginners-take-the-next-step-with-these-teacher-hosted-podcasts">Beginners: Take the Next Step With These Teacher-Hosted Podcasts</h2>

<p>This next section covers roughly the first jump in difficulty. While these podcasts are still very beginner friendly, they don't tend to pause between words or syllables. They might speak a bit slower than usual, or repeat key phrases, but they all feel a bit different from the first group. Of course, they still tend to constrain their vocabulary, grammar, and topics to ones that are more on the beginner side of things.</p>

<p>One way to think about doing listening practice is like practicing a musical instrument. In the beginning, you'll probably start slow, just trying to make sure you make as few mistakes as possible. As you get more comfortable, you might click the metronome up a few steps, until gradually you arrive at the speed the piece was meant to be played at. The same could be said for Japanese. While everyone has different natural speaking speeds, you can practice at different tempos, and work your way up to a generally natural speed. This group represents that first click up on the metronome!</p>

<h3 id="japanese-podcast-for-beginners-nihongo-con-teppei">Japanese Podcast for Beginners (Nihongo Con Teppei)</h3>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="japanese podcast for beginners nihongo con teppei" src="https://files.tofugu.com/japanese-learning-resources-database/japanese-podcast-for-beginners-nihongo-con-teppei/japanese-podcast-for-beginners-nihongo-con-teppei.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Most Japanese learners who have looked for listening practice are probably familiar with Teppei by now. A Japanese teacher on the platform iTalki, Teppei has long championed listening practice through podcasts, and come out with hours and hours of material through a number of different series, including solo podcasts for beginners, intermediate, and advanced learners, and a collaborative podcast with fellow online Japanese teacher Noriko.</p>

<p>This podcast, the aptly named Japanese Podcast for Beginners (Nihongo Con Teppei), is exactly as it says. Similar to his main podcast series aimed at lower-intermediate learners, Japanese Podcast for Beginners takes everything that’s great about that main series and makes it even more accessible. Episodes tend to be about 4 minutes long, covering a wide range of topics like many other Japanese podcasts.</p>

<p>Unlike many other Japanese podcasts aimed at beginners however, Teppei doesn’t really slow his speech much. Instead, he simply speaks clearly, only really pausing around the title or any other key phrases. Of course, it’s not quite a native speed conversation, but for beginners hoping to work their way up to more natural speed Japanese, Japanese Podcast for Beginners might be just the stepping stone you need.</p>

<h3 id="with-">日本語 with あこ</h3>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="nihongo with ako" src="https://files.tofugu.com/japanese-learning-resources-database/nihongo-with-ako/nihongo-with-ako.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Like so many Japanese language learning podcasts, 日本語 with あこ is a short monologue series hosted by the well-known online Japanese teacher, Ako. Ako has built up a reputation for her thoughtful classes online, particularly a course for Japanese learners hoping to work in Japan in the tech or game development fields.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, Ako’s podcast offers just the same level of consideration and care. Episodes are marked with emoji to indicate difficulty, with a bicycle signifying easier episodes, a rail car denoting N3 or intermediate level episodes, and a rocket indicating advanced episodes. She also does interviews, indicated by an emoji of two silhouettes.</p>

<p>Ako’s speech is clear and easily comprehensible, and episodes are interesting, often going a bit more in-depth than the standard survey you’ll find in most beginner-level Japanese podcasts. While she does her speech, particularly in the bicycle or rail car level episodes, the more thoughtful look at topics makes this a bit more thorough than some other Japanese podcasts. Finally, Ako makes transcripts available on Patreon for a $5 subscription fee for those that want it.</p>

<h3 id="podcast">日本語の聴解のためのpodcast</h3>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="nihongo no choukai no tame no podcast" src="https://files.tofugu.com/japanese-learning-resources-database/nihongo-no-choukai-no-tame-no-podcast/nihongo-no-choukai-no-tame-no-podcast.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Another weekly Japanese podcast series aimed at beginners, 日本語の聴解のためのpodcast offers what the title promises: listening comprehension practice. Started in the middle of 2020, the host Akane has now built up a catalog of over a hundred episodes. Each episode’s script is available for free on her blog, as well.</p>

<p>Akane will introduce pauses both in and after sentences, but in general her speech is smooth and flows well. Podcasts cover a range of topics like most beginner podcasts, but it’s more than just your standard simplistic fare. Instead, Akane talks about things more naturally, rather than introducing a simple topic like “cherry blossoms” and listing facts or asking questions.</p>

<p>With Akane’s clear speech, the free transcripts, and interesting topics, 日本語の聴解のためのpodcast manages to stand out in a crowded podcast field. Beginners looking for listening practice would be wise to heed the title — don’t pass this up!</p>

While the topics are a bit more advanced than other podcasts at this level, I find that to be a positive, as Akane keeps things fresh. Additionally, with the free transcripts, learners can check their comprehension later, or look up any new words they want to study more.</p>

<h2 id="upper-beginners-moving-closer-to-natural-speed-speech">Upper-Beginners: Moving Closer to Natural-Speed Speech!</h2>

<p>Finally, this group of podcasts tends to be one step closer to native speech. That said, they still cater to beginners in a variety of different ways. Additionally, these podcasts tend to be longer, too. This changes things in two main ways. For one, with a longer episode, it's more practice of course. Personally, I think listening practice, like reading practice, becomes more difficult in longer sessions; just like going for a longer jog is more difficult than going for a shorter run. Secondly, since these series' episodes run longer, they tend to cover a topic more in-depth, too. Because of this, it inherently introduces new grammar, vocabulary, and just adds complexity.</p>

<p>But don't get discouraged! These are all still well within the realm of "beginner level"; you got this. Just like all Japanese study, be diligent, stick with it, and enjoy the journey.</p>

<h3 id="momoko-to-nihongo">Momoko to Nihongo</h3>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="screenshot of the momoko to nihongo page on spotify" src="https://files.tofugu.com/japanese-learning-resources-database/momoko-to-nihongo/momoko-to-nihongo.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Momoko to Nihongo is another podcast series started in the middle of 2020, that’s since grown to over a hundred episodes. The eponymous host, Momoko, also has a popular YouTube channel for Japanese language learners, where she makes vlog videos about her daily life.</p>

<p>Similarly, Momoko to Nihongo covers a wide range of topics from Momoko’s life, such as earthquakes she’s experienced, or moments like losing her wallet. She also covers broader topics, such as studying abroad in Japan.</p>

<p>With the script available for free on her website, you can probably tell Momoko is very thoughtful about her word choice and grammar usage. That said, she’s not locked into this, as she offers interesting asides during her monologues. Additionally, she tends to offer more English support than other similarly-leveled Japanese language podcasts, explaining words or phrases she uses in English. Luckily, this isn’t that intrusive, but if you want to avoid any English at all, it’s something to be aware of.</p>

Given the personal aspect of this podcast, I think most people’s interest in this podcast will stem from how much they are interested in or relate to the host, Momoko. I like hearing her take on different topics, and her thoughts on aspects of Japanese culture. I do wish the podcast was entirely in Japanese, but she does a good job of offering support while not distracting from the goal. For Japanese learners looking to take the next step in their listening practice, look no further than Momoko to Nihongo.</p>

<h3 id="sayuri-saying-everyday-japanese-podcast">Sayuri Saying Everyday-Japanese Podcast</h3>

<p>Sayuri Saying Everyday-Japanese Podcast, hosted by, you guessed it, Sayuri, is a Japanese language learning podcast aimed at upper-beginner or lower-intermediate level Japanese learners. Sayuri additionally runs a YouTube channel that’s also popular among Japanese language learners, and actually, the podcast is largely an extension of that. Episodes are also posted to YouTube, and it’s on YouTube that learners will find the transcription should they want to check their comprehension.</p>

<p>Sayuri’s strength is in the naturalness of her speech. Rather than feeling stiff, her podcasts flow very naturally, striking a good balance of feeling unstilted while remaining easily comprehensible.</p>

<p>The topics continue this trend. Sayuri tends to discuss things from her life or from her interests like meditation or food, or aspects of Japanese culture such as the continued use of fax in Japan.</p>

<p>For Japanese language learners itching for more natural Japanese, while still being slow, Sayuri Saying Everyday-Japanese Podcast might be just what you need.</p>

That said, Sayuri keeps things comprehensible for beginners with inserted pauses and slightly slowed speech. For me, I think she strikes a great balance between natural and accessible, and should be near the top of the list for Japanese beginners looking to take a step forward with their listening skills.</p>

<h3 id="lets-talk-in-japanese">Let's Talk in Japanese</h3>

<figure class="figure-middle"><img alt="lets talk in japanese" src="https://files.tofugu.com/japanese-learning-resources-database/lets-talk-in-japanese/lets-talk-in-japanese.jpg" /></figure>

<p>One of the first podcasts you might be recommended if you’re looking for Japanese podcasts for language learners is Let’s Talk in Japanese. Hosted by Tomo, this weekly podcast series has accumulated over 200 episodes over the years. Episodes cover a variety of topics, and are tagged by the JLPT level Tomo intends them to correspond to, meaning there are podcasts for every level here, though the focus seems to be beginners.</p>

<p>Tomo’s speech is clear, though the audio quality could be a bit higher. Really, the incredible thing is the difference between the levels Let’s Talk in Japanese offers. Episodes tagged for N5 or N4 listeners are slow, with carefully selected grammar and words. But after working your way up to the N2 episodes, no punches are pulled. Tomo speaks at a completely normal speed, which can be disorienting if you’re not used to it. Luckily, there’s plenty of other episodes for Japanese learners who aren’t ready for it yet.</p>

<p>As he mentions on his website, the Japanese Tomo uses is conversational at all levels. It’s not perfect, scripted, error-free Japanese; instead, he keeps things natural, regardless of his speaking speed. While this might dissuade some, it’s perhaps the closest look to natural Japanese you’ll find in a podcast that’s suited to beginners.</p>

<p>Transcripts are available on Tomo’s website, though their release lags behind the episode releases quite a bit. That, coupled with the sub-par audio quality hold Let’s Talk in Japanese back from being a true homerun, but it’s still a great listen.</p>

<h2 id="the-last-word">The Last Word</h2>

<p>Regardless of your current Japanese abilities, podcasts are a great way to practice listening comprehension, and they're a lot of fun too. With so many podcasts out there, there's something for everyone. Hopefully this list helped you find a new favorite.</p>

<blockquote class="highlight-right">
  <p>Podcasts can be an awesome active listening practice, allowing you to check your understanding without the pressure of a conversation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember, the best podcast for you is going to be one you can comprehend most of, and find interesting enough to hold your attention and want to keep listening. Don't think you're going to be able to throw something on in the background like white noise and suddenly get good at Japanese while you sleep. However, podcasts can be an awesome active listening practice, allowing you to check your understanding without the pressure of a conversation.</p>

<p>Now get out there and get listening! I'll be back soon with an intermediate edition of this list as well, so if you found all these podcasts a bit too easy, or just want something else in the queue for when you get there, stay tuned!</p>
