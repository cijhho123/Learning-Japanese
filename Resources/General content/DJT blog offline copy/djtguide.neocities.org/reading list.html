The hardest person to understand is actually your boss, President Takagi, because of the technical language he uses when giving you tutorials, debriefings, etc. (Hibiki does speak in an Okinawan dialect, but it's not a thick one and she's still mostly understandable if you haven't gone out of your way to study it.) Overall the game probably requires about 1200-odd kanji to read comfortably (very rough estimate based on personal experience), and many words that would normally be written in Jouyou kanji will typically be written in kana instead. However, you will need to know the names of the prefectures of Japan to deal with the geography quizzes.	</td><td>	The Idolmaster 2 is a raising simulation game in which the player assumes the role of a producer who works at 765 Production (765 Pro), a talent agency that represents twelve pop idols who made their debuts half a year before the beginning of the story. At the beginning of the game, the player meets Junjirō Takagi, 765 Pro's president, and is tasked with creating a unit of three idols—a leader and two members—from nine of the agency's members:Haruka Amami, Miki Hoshii, Chihaya Kisaragi, Yukiho Hagiwara, Yayoi Takatsuki, Makoto Kikuchi, Mami Futami, Hibiki Ganaha, and Takane Shijou. The player and the selected idols are also tasked by Takagi to become nominated to the Idol Academy music awards festival and win awards within 52 weeks; the prerequisite of receiving an invitation from the academy is to attain a ranking of 20th or above in the singles sales chart by the 36th week of the year.	</td></tr>

Light use of historical spoken language grammar forms. Furigana occasionally used to provide idiosyncratic readings. Reading with Google at hand recommended to catch numerous historical/literary references.  	</td><td>	An all-star tag-team of Japan's greatest scholars, scientists, magicians, and the odd novelist or three square off against Imperial Japanese Army officer/evil wizard Yasunori Katō as he seeks repeatedly to destroy Tokyo, the titular Imperial Capital, and lay to rest the vengeful spirit of 10th century warlord Taira no Masakado. Their epic combat spans 90 years of fictionalized history over 12 volumes, and pulls in cameo appearances from pretty much everyone you've heard of (and more you probably haven't) from a 20th century Japanese history class. The movie adaptation, in its day one of the most expensive Japanese movies put to film, is a lickety-split adaptation of the first several volumes and a minor schlock tokusatsu masterpiece in its own right; its version of Katō is the primary inspiration for M. Bison from Street Fighter. Extremely nerdy and highly recommended. 	</td></tr>

There's a appendix at the back of the book which explains some of the harder chemistry and physics concepts, but you're not going to get by without a high school level chemistry vocabulary. Since this is a sci-fi work there's tons of narration as well with the author painstakingly describing the details of objects, how they work, mechanical concepts and more.	</td><td>	At first glance, it might look like your typical brainless light novel especially with that name, but it's actually a reference to Arthur C. Clarke's The Fountains of Paradise. In reality, the novel is more of a "What if x happened?" with constant progression rather than drama and shenanigans. Think Contact by Carl Sagan but with less emphasis on religion and politics. That said, the story is still very grounded in reality and each concept is thoroughly explained -- it's hard sci-fi after all. Nojiri Housuke has been writing SF stories since 1992, and he clearly knows his shit. Highly recommended one-shot novel especially for sci-fi lovers, and even if you don't particularly like sci-fi, it's still an extremely entertaining and well-researched novel that had me reading for hours on end.	</td></tr>

Without a doubt, one of the hardest novels I've ever read. The entire book is narrated as a soliloquy from our young 文学青年 university student who has a really, really large vocabulary and has tendencies to rant on certain topics suddenly. Yes, the vocabulary used in this novel is extremely wide and varied. It is, after all literature written for adults so idioms, proverbs and wordplay are thrown in your face mercilessly. You're not going to enjoy this if you haven't already read at least two 'Advanced' books. But ultimately, the author's quirky writing style isn't just for show, it lends great personality to each and every one of the characters, not just the MC.	</td><td>	"A fourth year university student descends into madness after being dumped by his girlfriend and begins stalking her. But it doesn't just end there. Tomihiko draws on his own rich experiences of campus life and lends a touch of realism to the cast as absurd as they might seem. And while the main character, Watashi, is presented as an overly arrogant prick, he is self-aware of it and jokes about himself semi-seriously throughout the entire novel.

As it was Tomohiko's debut work, the book isn't anywhere as good as Tatami Galaxy (I'm sure you've watched the anime) was and doesn't even really have an overarching plot. The book almost reads like a stream-of-consciousness autobiography until you realise it's fiction! But even without a clear ending in sight, the prose is fantastic and the characters will keep you laughing on every page. I definitely recommend this as one of the funniest and most sincere books I've ever read which doesn't take itself seriously at all."	</td></tr>

However, constant warfare forces humans to return to Earth, which has turned into an uninhabitable planet except for a certain area called the Divine States.
The Divine States are too small to accommodate all the humans, so they duplicated the area and created the Harmonic Divine States. In order to retrace their steps and rediscover their journey to the heavens, the returned humans began to reproduce history from the year 10,000 BC, using a mysterious history book called Testament.

Individuals who possess special powers acquired via science are called Espers. They possess their powers from birth, but most only awaken them during the Power Curriculum Program. Those Espers who awaken their abilities without the aid of special scientific instruments, whether at birth or through meditation, are referred to as Gemstones. Others, known as Magicians, gain their powers upon mastering the power of magic, either from obtaining knowledge from special books known as Grimoires or by using mystical artifacts, though the existence of magicians is a secret to the public. While Magicians align themselves with ancient religions, Espers are aligned with scientific institutions. This leads to a power struggle between the magic and science factions for control of the world.
The story is set in Academy City, a technologically advanced city located in western Tokyo that is known for its educational and research institutions. Tōma Kamijō is a student in Academy City whose right hand, the Imagine Breaker, has the ability to negate any supernatural power, but also negates his own luck, much to his chagrin. One day, Tōma meets a young English girl named Index - a nun from Necessarius, a secret magic branch of the Church of England, whose mind has been implanted with the Index Librorum Prohibitorum - 103,000 forbidden magical books that the Church has removed from circulation. His encounter with her leads him to meet others from the secret worlds of science and magic. Tōma's unusual power places him at the center of conflicts between the Magicians and Espers in Academy City who try to unravel the secrets behind Academy City, Index, and Tōma's own special power."	</td></tr>
