Typically, we don\u2019t associate words as being both. However, it is possible for the same word\/morpheme to appear in various parts of a sentence. The exact nuancing and syntax may differ, but a clear example of this scenario in English can be found with the word \u201clike.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The one&nbsp;<strong>like<\/strong>&nbsp;my dog,&nbsp;<strong>like<\/strong>, is the cutest of them all.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The cat-<strong>like<\/strong>&nbsp;animal is, in fact, more closely related to canines than felines.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The&nbsp;<strong>likely<\/strong>&nbsp;outcome will show that the dog is only partial<strong>ly<\/strong>&nbsp;wolfdog.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As seen in i., \u201clike\u201d usually goes after what it modifies. However, the filler-word function of \u201clike\u201d seen immediately after stems from this sense in which it appears at the front of a phrase. In ii. and iii., we see the word \u201clike\u201d used as a suffix with two distinct forms \u201c-like\u201d and \u201c-ly.\u201d This is a testament to how a single \u201cword\u201d may exhibit different syntax and morphological changes to match.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept of varying syntax based on placement is one theme of this discussion. The morphemes to be discussed all appear as \/ka\/. In addition to bearing the same appearance, each of them is used exclusively in adjectival phrases. These morphemes are as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The Prefix \u304b<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Suffix \u304b seen in \uff5e\u304b\u30fb\uff5e\u3089\u304b\u30fb\uff5e\u3084\u304b<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The \u304b ending for adjectives in Kyushu Dialects<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Our first objective is to study each morpheme and then conclude with whether they are truly one of the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To properly delve into these topics, many excerpts are taken from non-Modern Japanese works, ranging from Old Japanese to Early Modern Japanese.

However, it is considered archaic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u203bIt is possible that \u304b\u3084\u3059\u3057 survives in Modern Japanese as \u305f\u3084\u3059\u3044, given that the form \u305f\u3084\u3059\u3057 appears in Middle Japanese. The affix \u305f- is alternatively possibly linked to the \u305f found in verbs such as \u8b00\uff08\u305f\u3070\u304b\uff09\u308b (to think up a plan) and \u4f01\uff08\u305f\u304f\u3089\uff09\u3080 (to scheme), but the closeness in meaning of these verbs indicates that this \u305f- is separate from the one found in \u305f\u3084\u3059\u3044. However, there is one other example that doesn\u2019t survive in Modern Japanese, \u305f\u5fd8\u308b, which was likely used in an emphatic sense of \u201cto completely forget.\u201d In any event, we see that \u305f- attached itself to verbs whereas \u304b- attached to adjectives, so it is likely safe to assume that there was a simple change from \/k\/ to \/t\/ in the case of \u304b\u3084\u3059\u3057 \u2192 \u305f\u3084\u3059\u3057.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u203bSome scholars believe \u304b\u9752\u304f in Ex. 2 actually read as \u304b\u9752\u306b in the original Man\u2019yogana script. However, if this were true, it would be the only extant example of the prefix \u304b- in the formation of an adjectival noun. On the other hand, it would serve as a bridging context for the formation of the suffix -\u304b, which is to be discussed next.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Suffix\u00a0\uff5e\u304b\u3000\u3000<br>\u63a5\u5c3e\u8f9e\u306e\u300c\u304b\u300d\uff1a\uff5e\u3089\u30fb\u3089\u304b\u30fb\u3084\u304b<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The suffix -\u304b is an affix which describes the nature\/state of things, creating the stem of the majority of the native adjectival nouns (\u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e). Some grammarians shun away from accepting \u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e as a natural class of words. However, even before the introduction of Sino-Japanese adjectival nouns, the suffix -\u304b had already been employed to create \u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e centuries before the influx of Sino-Japanese examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, the suffix -\u304b is either seen directly after an adjectival root or more frequently seen after the intermediary affix -\u3089 (also seen as -\u3084\u203b).

For instance, \u306f\u3084\u308a\u304b meaning, \u201cfast-acting\/scatterbrain\/rushing\u201d is the result of -\u304b attaching to the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 of a verb, albeit one created from an adjectival root. Another example of -\u304b not directly following an adjectival root is \u714c\u3073\u3084\u304b (dazzling). Although \/kira\/ is an adjectival root, the \/bi\/ is thought to be the noun \u201cfire\u201d seen voiced because it is in a compound. We&#8217;ll look at more examples towards the end of this lesson.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u203bUsually, if an adjectival noun is formed by either \uff5e\u3089\u304b, \uff5e\u3084\u304b, or both, there won\u2019t be an alternative form without the \/-ra~ya\/ morpheme. However, an exception to this is \u7d30\u304b\uff08\u306a\uff09 as both it and \u7d30\u3084\u304b\uff08\u306a\uff09 are possible although with rather different meanings as can be gleamed from the examples below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. \u7d05\u306f\u3001\u305d\u306e\u8272\u5f69\u306e<strong>\u9bae<\/strong><strong>\u3084\u304b\u3055<\/strong>\u3067\u4eba\u3005\u3092\u9b45\u4e86\u3057\u3001\u53e4\uff08\u3044\u306b\u3057\u3048\uff09\u3088\u308a\u67d3\u6599\u3068\u3057\u3066\u7528\u3044\u3089\u308c\u3066\u304d\u305f\u3002<br>\u2018Kurenai\u2019 has mesmerized people for the vividness of its hues and has been used as a dye since ancient times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Word Note<\/strong>: \/kurenai\/ is a contraction of \u5449\uff08\u304f\u308c\uff09\u306e\u85cd.

Some adjectival roots could take both endings, but the exact number of such roots is small. In Lesson 14, we learned about some of the resulting adjective\/adjectival noun pairs made this way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Classical Japanese, there were two classes of \u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e: those whose conjunctive form (\u9023\u7528\u5f62) ended in \/-ku\/ and those whose conjunctive form ended in \/-shiku\/. All examples of the latter kind relate to abstract concepts, which if you remember from Lesson 14 was a contingency in the nuances of native \u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e.

It just so happens that \u7d30\u304b, with the predicative form \u7d30\u304b\u306a\u308a, would have been coined first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Modern Japanese, the modern predicative form \u7d30\u304b\u3060 is becoming exceedingly rare. However, because it has been used as a standalone \u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e for centuries, it is not ungrammatical to use it as such.

However, in older language, it could also be seen as an emphatic way of saying \u201cbright,\u201d indicating its relation to \u660e\u308b\u3044.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>118.&nbsp;<strong>\u660e\u308b\u3044<\/strong>\u592a\u967d\u306e\u4e0b\uff08\u3082\u3068\uff09\u3067\u5143\u6c17\u306b\u904a\u3076\u3002<br>To play full of energy under the bright sun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>119. \u5f7c\u306f<strong>\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b<\/strong>\u9593\u9055\u3044\u3068\u5206\u304b\u3063\u3066\u3082\u3001\u3042\u304f\u307e\u3067\u3082\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u9593\u9055\u3044\u3068\u8a8d\u3081\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>Even though he knows it&#8217;s clearly a mistake, he persistently attempts to not recognize it as his own mistake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>120. \u591c\u6df1\u304d\u6708\u306e<strong>\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b<\/strong>\u3055\u3057\u51fa\u3067\u3066<br>The moon deep in the night shines brightly\u2026<br>From the\u300e\u6e90\u6c0f\u7269\u8a9e\u30fb\u690e\u672c\u300f.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u325d\u3072\u3083\u3063\u3053\u3044<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>vs&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>\u51b7\u3084\u3084\u304b\uff08\u306a\uff09<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Root: \/hiya-\/<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The relationship between these words isn\u2019t that direct.

For instance, the common phrase \u8d64\u3089\u9854 used to describe \u201cred face\u201d upon blushing (due to alcohol) comes from \u8d64\u3089 + \u9854. \u8d64\u3089 can be analyzed as an adjectival noun meaning \u201cbeing very red,\u201d which is very fitting to describe someone who is plastered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This association with \u201cred face\u201d being a symptom of drinking alcohol actually led to the use of \u3042\u304b\u3089 being used as a euphemism for alcohol.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>136.&nbsp;<strong>\u3042\u304b\u3089<\/strong>\u5451\u3081\u3002<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drink liquor!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, although this sense of the word is no longer used, it is an example of how this affix did, in fact, create independent words.

For instance, \u540d\u53e4\u5c4b is merely \u5f53\u3066\u5b57, obscuring its real origin and meaning: \/nago\/ + \/ya\/ = \u201ctranquility.\u201d Although \/nagoya\/ doesn\u2019t exist as an adjectival noun in modern speech, the form \u548c\u3084\u304b still does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other examples of these toponyms can be found throughout Japan, but you have to look closely. In today\u2019s speech, we associate \u5c4b, also pronounced as \/ya\/ as a store title. However, this affix attaches strictly to nouns, so if we see \u3084\u30fb\u5c4b\u30fb\u5bb6 at the end of an adjective, it may actually be the affix \/-ya\/.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say there is a cafeteria named \u304a\u3060\u3084\u98df\u5802. Grammatically, we would have to analyze it is a compound word utilizing an adjective + the affix \/-ya\/ followed by the next noun. What say then about \u9ed2\u5bb6? Say this store specializes in \u9ed2\u8c5a, then it would appear that \u5bb6\u30fb\u5c4b should be interpreted literally as the store title suffix and that \u9ed2 is being used as a noun in reference to the kind of meat it serves.

In some regions of Kyushu, only the adjective \u3088\u3044 (good) is affected (\u2192 \u3088\u304b). However, traditionally, all adjectives as well as adjectival supplementary endings are affected. In some regions, the adjectival-noun \u7dba\u9e97 (pretty) is transformed into a \/-ka\/ ending \u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e, resulting in \u304d\u308c\uff08\u3044\uff09\u304b.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Etymologically speaking, this \uff5e\u304b derives from the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 form \uff5e\u304b\u308b, which was traditionally used when followed by auxiliary endings in Classical Japanese grammar (ex. \uff5e\u304b\u308b\u3079\u3057 = ought to be). Upon the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 and \u7d42\u6b62\u5f62 collapsing into one ending by late Middle Japanese, in southern Japan, the \uff5e\u304b\u308b form (\u30ab\u30ea\u6d3b\u7528) was kept instead of the base \u7d42\u6b62\u5f62 form ending in \/-shi\/ as was the case in the rest of Japan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>160. \u3053\u3093\u82b1\u306f\u3001\u307b\u3093\u306a\u3053\u3064\u7dba\u9e97<strong>\u304b<\/strong>\u3067\u3059\u306d\u3002<br>This flower is really pretty, huh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>161. \u3053\u308a\u3083\u3001\u81ed<strong>\u304b<\/strong>\u3002<br>Wow, this stinks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>162. \u884c\u304d\u305f<strong>\u304b\u30fc<\/strong>\u3002<br>Man, I wanna go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>163. \u307b\u3093\u306b\u6c17\u6301\u3061\u3093\u3088<strong>\u304b<\/strong>\u3089\u3057<strong>\u304b<\/strong>\u3002<br>It sounds like it\u2019s really pleasant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that while the swapping of \/-shi\/ to \/-ka\/ would seemingly make \u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e look identical to \/-ka\/ ending \u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e, the resemblance is superficial as the predicative (\u7d42\u6b62\u5f62) forms of the latter would still end in the appropriate form of the copula for the regional dialect, which in the case of Kyushu dialects would most likely either be \u3058\u3083 or \u3084.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In Conclusion&#8230;\u3000<br>\u6700\u5f8c\u306b\u2026<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having looked at these three \/ka\/ morphemes in great detail without even giving any mention to other \/ka\/ morphemes such as the particle \u304b, how to exactly interpret \/ka\/ in Japanese is by no means a simple matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of this discussion, we learned how even in Old Japanese, the prefix \/ka-\/ appeared to have been leaving the language. It is impossible to know to what degree it was used with adjectives before that time, but if it is the ancestor of the suffix \/-ka\/, their seemingly synonymous role of emphasizing state\/condition would be sufficient evidence to support its transformation from a prefix to a suffix. Ex. 2 serves as potentially the only bridging context to support this hypothesis, but if the hypothesis were true, then we could also say with some definitiveness that the emerging \/-ka\/ morpheme was partially responsible for the emergence and subsequent growth of the native adjectival-noun class even as it was still a prefix in growingly limited contexts, of which Ex. 2 would truly be a relic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The greatest finding this study has provided is how exactly the suffix \/-ka\/ marks the state\/appearance of things, often in figurative, intangible, and indirect contexts. This is in contrast to the basic, \u2018tangible\u2019 adjectival forms created with the affix \/-shi\/. This knowledge can help us distinguish between adjectival pairs that only differ by these affixes when they otherwise appear completely synonymous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, the affix \/-ka\/ seen in Kyushu dialects can be completely distinguished from the affix \/-ka\/ seen creating adjectival nouns out of adjectival roots from simply the fact that the resultant adjectives are not adjectival nouns. Furthermore, how exactly it formed and then spread is well documented. It is simply the Kyushu version of \/-shi\/ which came about from a complicated insertion and subsequent contraction of the existential verb \/ari\/ still seen in other adjectival conjugations in Modern Japanese (think the past tense &#8211;<em>katta<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The affix \/-ra~ya\/ was another interesting grammar point touched on in this lesson. Although it is deeply tied with the affix \/-ka\/, it still retains a degree of autonomy. In fact, it\u2019s also directly tied to the verbal forms \uff5e\u3089\u3050\u30fb\u3084\u3050 which can be seen with almost all examples of \uff5e\u3089\u304b\u30fb\u3084\u304b.
