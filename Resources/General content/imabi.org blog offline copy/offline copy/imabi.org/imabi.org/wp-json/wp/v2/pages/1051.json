These changes are actually multi-step processes which can be summarized by one change necessitating a solution to ultimately make the word &#8220;easier&#8221; to pronounce. In this installation, we will be learning about \u30a6\u97f3\u4fbf, in which the final step is the mora affected being pronounced as \/u\/*.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pronunciation Note<\/strong>: In Standard Japanese, the vowel \/u\/ is pronounced as [\u026f], but this is a sound change that affected Eastern Japanese dialects and prevented \u30a6\u97f3\u4fbf from being as prevalent. So, for historical accuracy, [\u026f] will only be used to refer to Eastern Japanese pronunciation and [u] will be used elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Phonological Rules Behind \u30a6\u97f3\u4fbf<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u30a6\u97f3\u4fbf Due to Close Vowel Deletion<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 1: \u30a6\u97f3\u4fbf first began by the close vowel (\u72ed\u6bcd\u97f3) \/u\/ or \/i\/ getting dropped. In the process, the roundness&nbsp;(&nbsp;\u25cc\u02b7&nbsp;)&nbsp;of \/u\/ or palatalizing effect (\u25cc\u02b2)&nbsp;of&nbsp;\/i\/ is&nbsp;transferred over to the consonant in the same mora.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summary: Drop \/u\/~\/i\/, transfer roundness\/palatalization&nbsp;to preceding consonant.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 2: In the case of velar&nbsp;(\u8edf\u53e3\u84cb\u97f3)&nbsp;morae \/ku\/ and \/gu\/, they&nbsp;manifest as \/k\u02b7\/ and \/g\u02b7\/ respectively. When the consonant weakens, becoming&nbsp;an approximant (\u63a5\u8fd1\u97f3), the velar articulation is lost. In doing so, the consonant of the following morae becomes voiced in the case of \/gu\/.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summary:&nbsp;\/k\u02b7\/ and \/g\u02b7\/ \u2192 \/w\/~\/j\/ (true nature of approximant lost to time). Voicing of \/g\/ transferred to following mora.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 2: In the case of (nasal)&nbsp;bilabial morae &#8211; \/bi\/, \/bu\/, \/mi\/, \/mu\/ &#8211; with the consonants \/b\/ and \/m\/ rendered as an approximant, their roundness articulation is still maintained, but the quality of \/u\/~\/i\/ also likely affected how this approximant was pronounced. What&#8217;s more, because \/m\/ is nasal, its nasality would have been mapped onto this approximant.&nbsp;<br>Summary: \/b\u02b7\/ \u2192 \/w\/~\/j\/, \/m\u02b7\/ \u2192 \/&nbsp;j\u0303&nbsp;\/~\/w\u0303\/<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\u203bIn the event that a nasal consonant follows in the next mora, some words deviate at Step 2 and exhibit a change to \/N\/ (a parallel phenomenon known as \u64a5\u97f3\u4fbf).<br>\u203bWhile the close vowel is dropped in Steps 1-2 and the consonant weakens, to maintain the moraic structure of Japanese and prevent consonant clusters, a schwa-like vowel may have been naturally inserted.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 3: The approximant&nbsp;changes to \/u\/~\/i\/\u203b.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 4: This \/u\/ is then subject to fusing with the vowel in the preceding mora if said mora exists. This diphthong reduction&nbsp;is known as&nbsp;\u76f4\u97f3\u5316, and when \/u\/ ends up after \/a\/, it results in [o:].&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u203bInstances of the approximant becoming \/i\/ are known as \u30a4\u97f3\u4fbf.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u30a6\u97f3\u4fbf Due to Deleting Medial \/w\/:&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>(<\/strong><strong>\/<\/strong><strong>\u0278u<\/strong><strong>\/<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;\u2192)&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>\/wu\/ \u2192 \/u\/<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another situation&nbsp;that is referred to as&nbsp;\u30a6\u97f3\u4fbf is&nbsp;what happened when&nbsp;medial \/\u0278\/ changed to \/w\/. If the vowel that follows was either \/u\/ already or became \/u\/ as a consequence or by happenstance, then \/w\/ would drop out due to \/wu\/ being an invalid mora. The result would be a mora that has been simplified to \/u\/. Likewise, if the consonant was already \/w\/ and its vowel changed to \/u\/, this would trigger the simplification of the mora to \/u\/.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Unorthodox \u30a6\u97f3\u4fbf: Inserting \/u\/<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Another phenomenon often referred to as \u30a6\u97f3\u4fbf that does not result from deleting a sound like in the situations above involves inserting \/u\/ into a&nbsp;word&nbsp;to seemingly make it easier to pronounce.

By the 18th century, the processes that had taken place had already been fairly documented, and beginning in the Meiji Period (1868-1912), the term \u30a6\u97f3\u4fbf became widespread.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at a handful of words on a case-by-case basis. In these examples, the steps mentioned below are condensed to what would at least appear in orthography. So, if \/mi\/ ultimately becomes \/u\/, the intermediary steps outlined above are omitted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>\u9eb9: \/ko:\u0291i\/ derives from the nominal form of the verb&nbsp;<em>kamosu<\/em>&nbsp;\u91b8\u3059 (to brew sake). The medial \/mo\/ in \/kamosi\/ was dropped, but the voicing carried over to the next mora, creating: \/kau\u207fzi\/. Later, the diphthong \/au\/ simplified to \/o:\/.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u624b\u6c34:&nbsp;This is&nbsp;known for meaning &#8220;water for washing one&#8217;s hands,&#8221; especially at a shrine. The reason for why it is pronounced as \/t\u0255o:z\u026f\/ today is due to \u30a6\u97f3\u4fbf. Originally, it was \/temi\u207fzu\/, but the medial \/mi\/ reduced to \/u\/, creating: \/teu&nbsp;\u207fzu\/.&nbsp;Then, by the&nbsp;diphthong \/eu\/ simplifying to \/o:\/, the initial consonant palatalized to produce its modern pronunciation.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u65e5\u5411: This&nbsp;word is famous for being the only native word to contain \/\u00e7\u026f &gt; h\u02b2u\/, and this too is thanks to \u30a6\u97f3\u4fbf. Its original pronunciation would have been \/pimuka\/. Over time, the \/p\/ became \/\u0278\/ and then later turned into \/h\/. As for the \u30a6\u97f3\u4fbf, the medial \/mu\/ simplified to \/u\/, and the juxtaposition of \/i\/ and \/u\/ naturally caused palatalization, giving its modern pronunciation of \/h\u02b2uga\/.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u7b04:&nbsp;\/ko:gai\/ meaning &#8220;hairpin&#8221; might not be recognizable as a compound word, but it is actually derived from \u9aea\u63bb\u304d, which would clearly be read as \/kamikaki\/. When the medial \/mi\/ reduced to \/u\/, the voicing moved over to the next mora, then the diphthong \/au\/ simplified to \/o:\/, producing the modern pronunciation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u7b92: The modern pronunciation of \/ho:ki\/ (broom) derives from \/papaki\/. Even in some dialects to this day, this can be recognized as the nominal form of an alternative form of the verb to sweep &#8211; \u6383\u308f\u304f.&nbsp;Going ahead with changing \/p\/ to \/h\/ for simplicity, once the second \/ha\/ changed to \/u\/, the resulting diphthong \/au\/ simplified to \/o:\/, producing the modern pronunciation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u82b3\u3057\u3044\u30fb\u99a8\u3057\u3044 has three valid pronunciations, each&nbsp;featuring a&nbsp;different sound change: \/ko:ba\u0255i:\/ (featuring \u30a6\u97f3\u4fbf), \/kam.bashi:\/ (featuring&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.imabi.net\/hatsuon.htm\">\u64a5\u97f3\u4fbf<\/a>), and \/kag\u026fwa\u0255ii\/ (featuring the medial&nbsp;\/\u0278\/ to [w] sound change which occurred in Middle Japanese). The word in any case is a combination of \u9999 \/ka\/ meaning &#8220;fragrance&#8221; and an archaic adjective \u7f8e\uff08\u304f\u306f\uff09\u3057 meaning &#8220;delicate\/beautiful.&#8221; When the medial&nbsp;\/gu\/ was reduced to \/u\/, the voicing carried over to the next mora and the resulting diphthong \/au\/ was then simplified to \/o:\/. In the second reading, the medial \/gu\/ became simplified to \/N\/ but still caused voicing onto the next mora due to assimilation.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u7533\u3059: \/mo:su\/ was once pronounced as \/mawosu\/. When \/wo\/ reduced to \/u\/, the resulting diphthong \/au\/ simplified to \/o:\/, producing the modern pronunciation.<br><br>\u203bAnother sound change omitted in these descriptions is an intermediary pronunciation of \/au\/. Before becoming \/o:\/, it was actually pronounced as \/ \u0254\u02d0\/.This sound was referred to as \u958b\u97f3. Likewise, the simplification of other diphthongs to \/o:\/ were called \u5408\u97f3.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Morpheme \/hito\/<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The morpheme \/\u00e7ito &gt; hito\/ is easily recognizable as the word for &#8220;person,&#8221; and given how fundamental this word it, it should come as no surprise that it would find itself used in various compound words. In Classical Japanese, it was not immune to \u30a6\u97f3\u4fbf, regardless if was voiced due to \u9023\u6fc1.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, examples of \u30a6\u97f3\u4fbf with \/hito\/ can be categorized by whether it became \/uto\/ or \/udo\/. In fact, this sound change is so noteworthy that it is one of the very few exceptions where a resulting diphthong which has since been simplified to \/o:\/ is still spelled as \/ou\/.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u203bIn the chart below, certain sound changes like \/p\/ to \/h\/ are simplified out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Modern Word<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;Sound Changes<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\u5f1f \/oto:to\/<br>(younger brother)<\/td><td>\/otohito\/ \u2192 \/otouto\/ \u2192&nbsp;\/oto:to\/&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u59b9 \/imo:to\/<br>(younger sister)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\/imohito\/ \u2192 \/imouto\/ \u2192&nbsp;\/imo:to\/&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u7d20\u4eba \/\u0255i\u027eo:to\/<br>(novice)<\/td><td>\/si\u027eohito\/ \u2192 \/si\u027eouto\/ \u2192&nbsp;&nbsp;\/\u0255i\u027eo:to\/<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u7384\u4eba \/k\u026f\u027eo:to\/<br>(veteran)<\/td><td>\/ku\u027eohito\/ \u2192 \/ku\u027eouto\/ \u2192&nbsp;&nbsp;\/k\u026f\u027eo:to\/<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u4ef2\u4eba \/nako:do\/<br>&nbsp;(matchmaker)<\/td><td>&nbsp; \/nakabito\/ \u2192 \/nakaudo\/ \u2192&nbsp;&nbsp;\/nako:do\/<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u72e9\u4eba \/ka\u027e\u02b2\u026f:do\/<br>(hunter)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\/ka\u027eibito\/ \u2192 \/ka\u027eiudo\/ \u2192&nbsp;&nbsp;\/ka\u027e\u02b2\u026f:do\/&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u8205 \/\u0255\u026f:to\/<br>(father-in-law)<\/td><td>&nbsp; \/sihito\/ \u2192 \/siuto\/ \u2192&nbsp;\/\u0255\u026f:to\/&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u8535\u4eba \/k\u026f\u027eo:do\/<br>(warehouse keeper)<\/td><td>&nbsp; \/ku\u027eabito\/ \u2192 \/ku\u027eaudo\/ \u2192&nbsp;&nbsp;\/k\u026f\u027eo:do\/&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Examples in Verbal Conjugations<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25a0<strong>\u30a6\u97f3\u4fbf in \u30ef\u884c\u4e94\u6bb5 Verb \u305f\u5f62\u30fb\u3066\u5f62 Conjugations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When learning how to conjugate the \u305f\u5f62 and \u3066\u5f62, you learned about \u4fc3\u97f3\u5316 in which the final mora of the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 of many \u4e94\u6bb5 verbs is simplified to a geminate consonant with the following consonant \/t\/.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ex. \u4f1a\u3046 \/a\u026f\/ \u2192&nbsp;\u4f1a\u3063\u3066 \/atte\/&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we respell this verb using old Kana orthography and retrace this sound change, we get:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>\u4f1a\u3075 \u2192 \u4f1a\u3072 \uff08\u9023\u7528\u5f62\uff09 \u2192 \u4f1a\u3063 + \uff5e\u3066 \uff1d \u4f1a\u3063\u3066<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s intriguing is that this use of \u4fc3\u97f3\u5316 was a key feature of Eastern Japanese dialects, but this did not occur for \u30ef\u884c\u4e94\u6bb5 (W-Column Godan Verbs) in Western Japanese dialects.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, the medial h-mora reduced to \/u\/ via \u30a6\u97f3\u4fbf.
