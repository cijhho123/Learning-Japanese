Direct objects are&nbsp;acted upon by an active agent (doer). Meaning, there is someone or something that is willfully exerting intent on another entity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>i. Sam&nbsp;<em>chopped<\/em>&nbsp;<strong>the lettuce<\/strong>.<br>ii. Sarah&nbsp;<em>threw&nbsp;<\/em><strong>the ball<\/strong>.<br>iii. Dusty&nbsp;<em>petted<\/em>&nbsp;<strong>the cat<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some verbs, however, do not involve an activity with an active agent. Some simply express a stative condition. For such verbs, the agent is not necessarily exerting his\/her control over the object. The relation between agent and object, then, can be viewed as a mere statement of reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>iv. I&nbsp;<em>understand<\/em>&nbsp;<strong>the situation<\/strong>.<br>v. I&nbsp;<em>have<\/em>&nbsp;<strong>three dogs<\/strong>.<br>vi. I&nbsp;<em>need<\/em>&nbsp;<strong>money<\/strong>.<br><br>These verbs (in italics) are all treated as transitive verbs because, in English, they have objects (in bold). However, their meanings are stative in nature. A stative verb is one that expresses a state\/condition rather than an activity. In English, stative verbs can either be intransitive or transitive depending on whether there is an object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>vii. There are horses here. (intransitive)<br>viii. The flag stands still. (intransitive)<br>ix. The fire burns brightly. (intransitive)<br>x. Everyone wants money. (transitive)<br>xi. I like dogs. (transitive)<br>xii. I hate cats. (transitive)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In English, while objects are typically linked to verbs of activity, this is not the case for stative-transitive verbs. In fact, these verbs share much in common with adjectives. After all, adjectives are primarily used in expressing the state\/condition of something. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>xiii. I\u2019m good at math.<br>xiv. I\u2019m bad at physics.<br>xv. Spiders are scary.<br>xvi. I\u2019m scared of spiders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it be a stative-transitive verb or an adjective with an object, they both constitute what are called stative-transitive predicates. In Japanese, the <em>objects<\/em> of these so-called &#8220;stative-transitive predicates&#8221; are marked by&nbsp;\u304c as opposed to&nbsp;\u3092.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These predicates involve perception, necessity, possession, inherent desire, etc. An important commonality is that, in Japanese, these attributes are all viewed as being&nbsp;<strong>outside the realm of the agent&#8217;s control<\/strong>. Even when someone &#8220;wants something,&#8221; the want is treated as an emotion the speaker (agent of the wanting) cannot control. This lack of control prompts the Japanese mind to use \u304c over&nbsp;\u3092. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stative-transitive predicates carry over into Japanese as either&nbsp;intransitive verbs, the subtype of which will be called stative-ergative predicates for the purpose of this discussion, or&nbsp;as adjectives\/adjectival nouns. Why some&nbsp;correspond to intransitive verbs and others to&nbsp;adjectives\/adjectival nouns may seem arbitrary because,&nbsp;either way, they are still predicates with objects marked by&nbsp;\u304c, but it will be important to view them as unique grammatical environments to study individually. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Japanese, &#8220;intransitive verb&#8221;&nbsp;\u81ea\u52d5\u8a5e refers not only to verbs that have no objects, but also to verbs whose objects are marked by&nbsp;\u304c<sup data-fn=\"6739f8b7-204c-43cb-b394-659da588379e\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#6739f8b7-204c-43cb-b394-659da588379e\" id=\"6739f8b7-204c-43cb-b394-659da588379e-link\">2<\/a><\/sup>, and&nbsp;&#8220;transitive verb&#8221;&nbsp;\u4ed6\u52d5\u8a5e is reserved only to verbs with an active agent whose objects are marked by&nbsp;\u3092.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we have learned what stative-transitive predicates are in English, it is time to see how they <strong>manifest<\/strong> in Japanese. These predicates will be divided into two broad categories with further semantic divisions, as shown below. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Objective Stative Predicates<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u30fbPossession<br>\u30fbNecessity<br>\u30fbNon-intentional Perception<br>\u30fbNon-intentional Understanding<br>\u30fbAbility<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Subjective Stative Predicates<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u30fbInternal Feeling<br>\u30fbLike\/Dislike<br>\u30fbWant\/Desire<br>\u30fbCompetence<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these categories exhibit interchangeability between<em>&nbsp;<\/em>\u304c and&nbsp;\u3092. In this lesson, we will focus first on the instances&nbsp;\u304c seems to mark the object, and in later lessons, we will investigate these circumstances on a more individual basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Objective Stative Predicates&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>\u5ba2\u89b3\u7684\u72b6\u614b\u52d5\u8a5e\u8ff0\u8a9e\u306e\u5bfe\u8c61\u3092\u8868\u3059\u300c\u304c\u300d<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we delve into what these verbs look like in Japanese, let&#8217;s revisit past discussions that will be pertinent to the discussions in this lesson.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;The subject\/agent&nbsp;of a&nbsp;stative-ergative predicate must be a&nbsp;person&nbsp;or&nbsp;a personified entity. Otherwise, the particle&nbsp;\u304c would simply be marking the subject of a typical intransitive verb.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. The subject and topic are <strong>often<\/strong> the same entity. When said entity is marked as the&nbsp;topic&nbsp;by&nbsp;\u306f,&nbsp;the subject is still the X element of the basic sentence structure X [\u304c\u30fb\u306f] \uff08Y\u3092) Z<sup data-fn=\"96edbf4a-cca0-4f7b-bf10-9b362114421e\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#96edbf4a-cca0-4f7b-bf10-9b362114421e\" id=\"96edbf4a-cca0-4f7b-bf10-9b362114421e-link\">3<\/a><\/sup>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. When the subject is marked by&nbsp;\u304c and there is also another&nbsp;\u304c to mark the object of a stative-ergative predicate, the subject<em>&nbsp;<\/em>\u304c is exhaustive in nature<sup data-fn=\"c020711f-8855-473f-a488-6899a25a7732\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#c020711f-8855-473f-a488-6899a25a7732\" id=\"c020711f-8855-473f-a488-6899a25a7732-link\">4<\/a><\/sup>.

However, the translation &#8220;I&#8217;m scared of ghosts&#8221; best reflects the grammatical reality we have been discussing so far. &#8220;Ghost&#8221; would be the object of a Japanese stative-ergative predicate, and the agent (the one who is acting all afraid toward ghosts) would be the &#8220;I&#8221; of the sentence, which would be simply omitted, as is generally common in Japanese in the first place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>29. \u79c1\u304c\u6016\u3044\uff1f<br>I\u2019m scary?<br>Are you scared of me?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>30. \u300c\u4ffa\u3001\u30af\u30e2\u304c\u6016\u304f\u306a\u3044\u3088\u300d\u300c\u672c\u5f53\uff1f\u50d5\u306f\u6016\u3044\u3051\u3069\u3002\u300d<br>\u201cMe, I\u2019m not afraid of spiders.\u201d \u201cReally?

Japanese transitive verbs require that the doer (agent), which in their case is equivalent to the subject, willfully (=purposefully) acts upon the direct object.  <a href=\"#eda5bc94-09b7-4dcf-a489-0924933432ca-link\" aria-label=\"\u811a\u6ce8\u53c2\u71671\u306b\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\">\u21a9\ufe0e<\/a><\/li><li id=\"6739f8b7-204c-43cb-b394-659da588379e\">When an &#8220;object&#8221; corresponds to the subject of an intransitive predicate, that intransitive predicate may also be specifically denoted as an <em>ergative<\/em>-like predicate. This indicates that \u81ea\u52d5\u8a5e, as a kind of verb, can be further broken down into at least three different subtypes:<br>1. Stative-Ergative Intransitive (ex. \u308f\u304b\u308b (to understand)): Intransitive verbs whose agents are not willful doers, and by their semantic objects being marked with \u304c, it seems as though there is no agent at all.   <br>2. Unergative Intransitive (ex. \u7b11\u3046 (to laugh)): Intransitive verbs in which the subject is an agent (willful doer) actively initiating said action. <br>3. Unaccusative Intransitive (ex. \u6b7b\u306c (to die)): Intransitive verbs with no agent at all. The person who dies is the subject of the dying, and that subject cannot be viewed as an agent. <br>Distinguishing between the first two types is generally overlooked in Japanese grammar discussions. One reason for this is that verbs noted to be &#8220;ergative&#8221; in Japanese, as well as English for that matter, are those which can be used intransitively or transitively without change in word form, of which \u7b11\u3046 is actually an example of this:<br>i. \u4eba\u3092\u7b11\u3046 = &#8220;to laugh <em>at<\/em> someone&#8221; \u2192 transitive<br>vs<br>ii. \u8ab0\u304b\u304c\u7b11\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b = &#8220;someone is laughing&#8221; \u2192 intransitive<br>In this scenario, the object argument is marked by \u3092 when the verb is transitive\/accusative, but when the verb is intransitive\/unaccusative, that same argument as before is now the subject argument and is, thus, marked by \u304c. What, then, makes the intransitive iteration unergative? The first issue is that &#8220;ergative&#8221; verb is not quite the right word. Instead, viewing these verbs themselves as ambitransitive (\u4e21\u7fa9\u52d5\u8a5e), is more appropriate, in the same way labeling stative-transitive realizations in Japanese as being ergative as opposed to ergative-like is similarly misleading.       <br>So, what prevents intransitive verbs like \u308f\u304b\u308b from being blanketly labeled as &#8220;ergative&#8221; predicates? <br>One, these verbs do not typically have instances, at least without additional morphology, in which they can be used as typical transitive verbs. This rules out using the word &#8220;ergative&#8221; synonymously with the concept of &#8220;ambitransitivity&#8221; in morphology. These stative-transitive-equivalent predicates in Japanese all, however, may be likened to transitive-functioning paraphrases. For instance, the semantic similarity between \u308f\u304b\u308b and \u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b is uncanny.

This prevents these predicates from being ergative in the overall case marking structure of Japanese. Typically, languages are one of two types: ergative vs. accusative. In an ergative language, intransitive subjects and transitive objects take the same case markers (or are grammatically treated as being the same) and transitive subjects (=agent) are handled differently. In Japanese, there are not separate subject markers depending on whether a verb is intransitive or transitive; therefore, it is not an ergative language. Instead, Japanese is an accusative language. In these languages, intransitive subjects and transitive subjects (=agents) take the same case markers (or are grammatically treated as being the same), and it is the object of transitive verbs that take a different case marker.  <br>Another confusing factor is that even if we grant that predicates like \u308f\u304b\u308b are ergative-like, we cannot label \u304c as being the &#8220;ergative case (\u80fd\u683c),&#8221; as that is meant to refer to transitive subjects in those languages, not the equal treatment of all (or some) intransitive subjects and transitive objects. The latter is known as the absolutive case (\u7d76\u5bfe\u683c), which is what would be at play as in how this all pertains to \u304c as an object marker. <br>In conclusion, ergativity as a phenomenon is triggered in Japanese ONLY when the agency (willfulness) of the agent is near zero or non-existent. At this point, the agent&#8217;s object becomes marked by \u304c as opposed to \u3092, as the complement in question is being perceived as a subject with the perceived absence of an agent. These predicates are all stative-transitive in English, which further exemplifies the innate interchangeability between the notion of &#8220;subject&#8221; and &#8220;object&#8221; in the context of ergative predicates, with this restrictive environment crucial to the phenomenon&#8217;s minor appearance in Japanese, as it is crucially not endemic in the language. As how this all pertains to what \u304c is, though, in terms of case, as opposed to marking the nominative\/accusative case \u4e3b\u683c, it would be marking the absolutive case \u7d76\u5bfe\u683c for these predicates. In this light, the subject \u304c and the<em> object<\/em> \u304c can be delineated in terminology as NOT being one and the same, albeit with the concession that further research can one day resolve the apparent lack of proper terminology for \u304c\u30fb\u3092 interchangeability in lieu of actual ergative languages.     <br>  <a href=\"#6739f8b7-204c-43cb-b394-659da588379e-link\" aria-label=\"\u811a\u6ce8\u53c2\u71672\u306b\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\">\u21a9\ufe0e<\/a><\/li><li id=\"96edbf4a-cca0-4f7b-bf10-9b362114421e\">As for the deep sentence structure of sentences with ellipsed instances of \u304c, there are two synonymous approaches:<br>X <s>[subject marker]<\/s> [topic marker] <br><s>X [subject marker]<\/s> X [topic marker]<br>These different approaches can be reconciled with an algebraic approach by notating them together as: X(subject + topic).

This indicates that \u81ea\u52d5\u8a5e, as a kind of verb, can be further broken down into at least three different subtypes:<br>1. Stative-Ergative Intransitive (ex. \u308f\u304b\u308b (to understand)): Intransitive verbs whose agents are not willful doers, and by their semantic objects being marked with \u304c, it seems as though there is no agent at all.   <br>2. Unergative Intransitive (ex. \u7b11\u3046 (to laugh)): Intransitive verbs in which the subject is an agent (willful doer) actively initiating said action. <br>3. Unaccusative Intransitive (ex. \u6b7b\u306c (to die)): Intransitive verbs with no agent at all. The person who dies is the subject of the dying, and that subject cannot be viewed as an agent. <br>Distinguishing between the first two types is generally overlooked in Japanese grammar discussions. One reason for this is that verbs noted to be \\\"ergative\\\" in Japanese, as well as English for that matter, are those which can be used intransitively or transitively without change in word form, of which \u7b11\u3046 is actually an example of this:<br>i. \u4eba\u3092\u7b11\u3046 = \\\"to laugh <em>at<\/em> someone\\\" \u2192 transitive<br>vs<br>ii. \u8ab0\u304b\u304c\u7b11\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b = \\\"someone is laughing\\\" \u2192 intransitive<br>In this scenario, the object argument is marked by \u3092 when the verb is transitive\/accusative, but when the verb is intransitive\/unaccusative, that same argument as before is now the subject argument and is, thus, marked by \u304c. What, then, makes the intransitive iteration unergative? The first issue is that \\\"ergative\\\" verb is not quite the right word. Instead, viewing these verbs themselves as ambitransitive (\u4e21\u7fa9\u52d5\u8a5e), is more appropriate, in the same way labeling stative-transitive realizations in Japanese as being ergative as opposed to ergative-like is similarly misleading.       <br>So, what prevents intransitive verbs like \u308f\u304b\u308b from being blanketly labeled as \\\"ergative\\\" predicates? <br>One, these verbs do not typically have instances, at least without additional morphology, in which they can be used as typical transitive verbs. This rules out using the word \\\"ergative\\\" synonymously with the concept of \\\"ambitransitivity\\\" in morphology.
