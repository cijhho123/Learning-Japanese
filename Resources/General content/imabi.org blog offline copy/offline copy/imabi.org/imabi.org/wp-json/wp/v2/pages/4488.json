What is meant by approximations is when a speaker waves between two numbers. For instance, rather than saying &#8220;two people,&#8221; one might say &#8220;two, three people.&#8221; <br><br>Though rather straightforward with a fairly strong understanding of how numbers and counter phrases are read, learners may be flustered nonetheless by the internal inconsistencies in readings that plague certain numbers, especially 4, 7, and 9, along with the sound changes (albeit highly predictable). <br><br><strong>Orthography Note<\/strong>: To recreate how number\/counter phrases are used in native environments, numerals will appear in Arabic numerals (half-width or full-width) as well as in kanji. Furthermore, as a comma use also fluctuates in font and appearance, that variation will also be represented in the examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u6982\u6570 w\/o Counters<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, we will learn how to express &#8220;1-2,&#8221; &#8220;2-3, &#8220;3-4,&#8221; etc. without the intervention of counters. Predominant readings are listed first and highlighted in bold. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td>1-2<\/td><td>\u3044\u3061\u306b<\/td><td>2-3<\/td><td>\u306b\u3055\u3093<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3-4<\/td><td>\u3055\u3093\u3057<\/td><td>4-5<\/td><td>\u3057\u3054<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5-6<\/td><td>\u3054\u308d\u304f<\/td><td>6-7<\/td><td><strong>\u308d\u304f\u3057\u3061<\/strong><br>\u308d\u304f\u306a\u306a<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7-8<\/td><td><strong>\u3057\u3061\u306f\u3061<\/strong><br>\u306a\u306a\u306f\u3061<\/td><td>8-9<\/td><td><strong>\u306f\u3063\u304f<\/strong><br><strong>\u306f\u3061\u304f<\/strong><br>\u306f\u3061\u304d\u3085\u3046<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, this pattern does not bridge between powers. When a speaker wishes to say &#8220;around 10&#8221; or &#8220;around 100,&#8221; there is no sense in rounding the figure for lower powers, as that defeats the purpose of rounding. Meaning, while it is still naturally to say the equivalent of &#8220;around 100 people&#8221; (100\u4eba\u304f\u3089\u3044), it is not as naturally to say, &#8220;around 99, 100 people&#8221; (99\u3001100\u4eba\u304f\u3089\u3044). <br><br>You will also notice a general tendency to favor Sino-Japanese readings of numbers with rounded figures with numbers whose native versions have been incorporated into the Sino-Japanese number series (4, 7, 9). This is also borne out in set phrases.<br><br>1. \u5341\u4e2d\u516b\u4e5d\uff08\u3058\u3063\u3061\u3085\u3046\u306f\u3063\u304f\uff09<br>Literally: In 8 or 9 cases of ten<br>In all probability <sup data-fn=\"2636681e-b1e6-45be-a7a1-73fafeba9a1c\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#2636681e-b1e6-45be-a7a1-73fafeba9a1c\" id=\"2636681e-b1e6-45be-a7a1-73fafeba9a1c-link\">1<\/a><\/sup><br><br>Though it is rather unnatural to extend this pattern between powers, it is perfectly fine within powers. <br><br>2. \uff11\uff15\uff0c\uff16\u306e\u5c11\u5e74<br>A juvenile between 15-16. <br><br>3. \u4e8c\u3001\u4e09\u767e<sup data-fn=\"e547c45a-5cb6-4263-8b2e-71f9fc843231\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#e547c45a-5cb6-4263-8b2e-71f9fc843231\" id=\"e547c45a-5cb6-4263-8b2e-71f9fc843231-link\">2<\/a><\/sup><br>2-300<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u6982\u6570 w\/ Counters<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The general rule of thumb is that whatever reading a number that is used with a given counter reigns supreme when the number is directly followed by said counter, while the first number stated in the \u6982\u6570 will still favor the Sino-Japanese number. For example, while &#8220;3, 4&#8221; is generally read as \u3055\u3093\u3057, when the counter phrase with 4 is not read as \u3057, it is replaced with the appropriate reading. <br><br>4. \uff13\u3001\uff14\u6642\u9593\uff08\u3055\u3093<strong>\u3088<\/strong>\u3058\u304b\u3093\uff09<br>3, 4 hours<br><br>5. \uff13\u3001\uff14\u5343\uff08\u3055\u3093<strong>\u3088\u3093<\/strong>\u305b\u3093\uff09<br>3-4,000<br><br>As for sound changes that may occur to the first digit, those sound changes may still occur regardless of what reading is used for the second digit. For example, while 9 is usually rendered as \u304d\u3085\u3046 with most counters, a preceding 8 may be pronounced as either \u306f\u3061 or \u306f\u3063.<br><br>6. \uff18\u3001\uff19\u56de\uff08\u306f\u3061\u304d\u3085\u3046\u304b\u3044\u30fb\u306f\u3063\u304d\u3085\u3046\u304b\u3044\uff09<br>8, 9 times<br><br>Prior to the 1950s, the default pronunciations of 4, 7, and 9 were \u30b7, \u30b7\u30c1, and \u30af respectively in all counter expressions, as they technically remain as the traditionally correct readings. As unnatural as implementing them back into counter expressions in which they have fallen out of use may be, do not bewildered when encountering them in older literature or in the speech of people from surviving individuals of those generations. <br><br>As for the especially exceptional readings for the counters \uff5e\u65e5 (period of days) and \uff5e\u4eba (people), the Sino-Japanese readings of the numbers are heavily favored so as to avoid switching between the native and Sino-Japanese renditions of the counters. Overall, however, the same factors mentioned thus far still apply. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td>\u6982\u6570<\/td><td>\uff5e\u65e5<\/td><td>\uff5e\u4eba<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1-2<\/td><td>\u3044\u3061\u306b\u306b\u3061<\/td><td><strong>\u3072\u3068\u308a\u304b\u3075\u305f\u308a<\/strong><br>\u3044\u3061\u306b\u306b\u3093<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2-3<\/td><td>\u306b\u3055\u3093\u306b\u3061<\/td><td>\u306b\u3055\u3093\u306b\u3093<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3-4<\/td><td>\u3055\u3093\u3088\u3063\u304b<\/td><td>\u3055\u3093\u3088\u306b\u3093<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4-5<\/td><td>\u3057\u3054\u306b\u3061<\/td><td>\u3057\u3054\u306b\u3093<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5-6<\/td><td>\u3054\u308d\u304f\u306b\u3061<\/td><td>\u3054\u308d\u304f\u306b\u3093<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6-7<\/td><td><strong>\u308d\u304f\u3057\u3061\u306b\u3061<\/strong><br>\u308d\u304f\u306a\u306a\u306b\u3061<\/td><td><strong>\u308d\u304f\u3057\u3061\u306b\u3093<\/strong><br>\u308d\u304f\u306a\u306a\u306b\u3093<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7-8<\/td><td><strong>\u3057\u3061\u306f\u3061\u306b\u3061<\/strong><br>\u306a\u306a\u306f\u3061\u306b\u3061<\/td><td><strong>\u3057\u3061\u306f\u3061\u306b\u3093<\/strong><br>\u306a\u306a\u306f\u3061\u306b\u3093<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8-9<\/td><td><strong>\u306f\u3061\u304f\u306b\u3061<br>\u306f\u3063\u304f\u306b\u3061<\/strong><br>\u306f\u3061\u304d\u3085\u3046\u306b\u3061<br>\u306f\u3063\u304d\u3085\u3046\u306b\u3061<\/td><td><strong>\u306f\u3061\u304f\u306b\u3093<br>\u306f\u3063\u304f\u306b\u3093<\/strong><br>\u306f\u3061\u304d\u3085\u3046\u306b\u3093<br>\u306f\u3063\u304d\u3085\u3046\u306b\u3093<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From this chart, we can deduce a few stark irregularities.

However, unlike the \u6982\u6570 expressions discussed thus far, there is no need for the numbers mentioned to be chronological. Rather, the figures mentioned sound more so like guesses in which the speaker can easily jump around figures. In this scenario, it must also be duly noted that the &#8220;# + counter&#8221; is typically stated on each side of \u304b, and this becomes obligatory in situations like \u4e00\u4eba\u304b\u4e8c\u4eba with special readings.<br><br>7. 15\u4eba\u304b20\u4eba<br>15 or 20 people<\/p>\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-footnotes\"><li id=\"2636681e-b1e6-45be-a7a1-73fafeba9a1c\">Though \u5341\u4e2d (among ten) is traditionally read as \u3058\u3063\u3061\u3085\u3046, it is often now read as \u3058\u3085\u3063\u3061\u3085\u3046 or even uncontracted as \u3058\u3085\u3046\u3061\u3085\u3046. <a href=\"#2636681e-b1e6-45be-a7a1-73fafeba9a1c-link\" aria-label=\"\u811a\u6ce8\u53c2\u71671\u306b\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\">\u21a9\ufe0e<\/a><\/li><li id=\"e547c45a-5cb6-4263-8b2e-71f9fc843231\">Sound changes that generally occur within Sino-Japanese numbers also occur with rounded numbers.
