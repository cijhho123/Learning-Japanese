An example of this in English is the article &#8220;a(n)&#8221; clearly sharing the same origin as the number &#8220;one.&#8221; However, the original meaning still serves as the mold for how the current meaning functions. If this were applied to \uff5e\u306c, then one would at least expect these &#8220;past&#8221; situations which have become completed would be far &#8220;past&#8221; the speaker, but that is not the case. The situations described still affect the speaker at some level whether it be a &#8220;past perfect,&#8221; present perfect,&#8221; or &#8220;future perfect,&#8221; and the latter two definitions ought not have been possible had the ending been so obviously from\u00a0\u53bb\u306c to speakers at the time.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Point 3: Number of \/-nu\/-FInal Verbs is Irrelevant<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Confusion between the auxiliary \uff5e\u306c and verbs ending in \u306c is not plausible, as \u53bb\u306c was not the only example of such verbs, though, admittedly, such instances are indeed limited.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Point 4: Other Potential Origins <\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Another issue is the likelihood of a perfect tense deriving from a verb meaning &#8220;to go (away)&#8221; as opposed to a copular expression as they did in Indo-European languages. With the Classical Japanese copular \u306a\u308a beginning in \/n\/ as well, it is likely that a basal \/n\/-initial copula expression is responsible for the birth of \uff5e\u306c as the perfect tense marker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Auxiliary Verb \uff5e\u3064<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\uff5e\u3064 is the transitive equivalent of \uff5e\u306c,&nbsp;generally indicating&nbsp;deliberate actions that have been completed.
