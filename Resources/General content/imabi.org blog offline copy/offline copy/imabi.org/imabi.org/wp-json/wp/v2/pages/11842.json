Ultimately, both patterns represent change in state, condition, or circumstance, but what is meant by &#8220;change&#8221; and how that all comes about must all be taken into consideration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\uff5e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308b<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is tempting to simply define \uff5e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308b as indicating a change in state, there is, of course, more to it than that. <br><br>Firstly, it is crucial to view what \uff5e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308b directly follows as an embedded clause (\u57cb\u3081\u8fbc\u307f\u6587) that it is a part of. The embedded clauses that work with it exhibit the following two semantic restrictions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The state, condition, or circumstance described does not intrinsically exhibit a sense of progression, as that role is held by \uff5e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308b itself.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The state, condition, or circumstance at hand occurs without active (volitional) input by an agent, including when an agent happens to be present.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>These restrictions can be proven with the naturalness and interpretations of the following sentences.<br><br>1. \u3060\u3093\u3060\u3093\u75b2\u308c\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002?<br>Intended Meaning: I&#8217;ve gradually become tired.<br>Actual Meaning: Gradually, that would result in me becoming tired.<br><br>2. \u592a\u90ce\u541b\u304c\u3001\u6bce\u65e5\u904a\u3073\u306b\u304f\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>Taro came to play every day.<br><br>3. \u30c6\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u541b\u306f\u672c\u3092\u8aad\u3080\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>Taylor-kun reads books now. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason for why Ex. 1 is typically unnatural is because the verb \u75b2\u308c\u308b (to tire) is intrinsically a state that worsens over time, so for the sentence to be valid, that has to be put to the side, and in place of a moment, multiple occurrences leads the experiencer to be in the position of tiring in the first place. <br><br>On the flip side, what makes Ex. 3 natural even though the agent Taylor-kun is presumably reading those books of his own free will is the habitual nature of said conduct. <br><br>Next, taking a step back to Ex. 2, we see that while the verb phrase used in the embedded clause does not intrinsically relate to a situation that progresses over time, it is perceived as such thanks to \uff5e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308b.  <br><br>By combining these factors together, five unique environments can be isolated which involve \uff5e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308b describing &#8220;reaching&#8221; said points as a progression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Inanimate entity subjects exhibiting a change in state.

The non-volitional representation of change in state denoted by \uff5e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308b touches on how intransitive structures work in Japanese, especially the ones that are not always rendered intransitive upon being translated into English.

I made red and green stand out.<br><br>When we jab at various other aspects of phrasing, though, the choice between \u304c and \u3092 may not always be so simple. <br><br>17. \u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3059\u308b\u3068\u8868\u793a\uff5b\u304c \u3007\u30fb\u3092 X\uff5d\u5909\u308f\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I had it so that the display will change when you click (it).<br><br>Returning to Ex. 17, we see that the agent sets the result in motion via clicking, not by directly acting upon the display itself.

If \u304c were used, then &#8220;strong points&#8221; would no longer be inherent to the agent, reminding us that X&#8217; in an embedded clause (Z) would have to be separate from X. Meaning, we are looking at an example of X\u304cY\u3092Z that cannot be restructured as X\u306f[X&#8217;\u304c(Y&#8217;\u3092)]=Z.<br><br>47. \u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8\uff5b\u304c \u25ce\u30fb\u3092 \u25b3\uff5d\u6765\u306a\u3044\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u306e\u306b\u3001\u6765\u306a\u3044\u539f\u56e0\u306f\u306a\u305c\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f<br>What&#8217;s the cause behind me not getting texts even though I haven&#8217;t set it so that I don&#8217;t get them?<br><br>The past two examples have demonstrated how X\u306fY\u3092Z and X\u306f[X&#8217;\u304c(Y&#8217;\u3092)]=Z, in the greater scheme of things, are separate structures which happen to overlap depending on what fits inside \uff5e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3059\u308b on the clausal level. That overlap can then be determined by comparing the logical outcome of both structures and seeing if they are still synonymous. As for Ex. 47, we see that it is in the grey zone of these structures. Is the agent actually acting upon the text messages? Maybe. Blocking texts from a specific person that one knows will continue coming in not stopped seems reasonable &#8211; granted \uff5e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3059\u308b itself is actually in the negative &#8211; but because blocking messages involves setting up the phone so that texts do not reach you, this results in \u304c being the more appropriate choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Misnomers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having learned so much about \uff5e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308b and \uff5e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3059\u308b, it is worth noting briefly what this lesson is not about: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Adjectives\/Adjectival Nouns + \uff5e\u3088\u3046\u306b, which may be followed by \u3059\u308b to indicate behavior being a certain way.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Complex adverbial phrases created with \uff5e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3057\u3066.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>47. \u5927\u4e08\u592b\u3001\u60aa\u3044\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306f\u3057\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3089<sup data-fn=\"f9f6d833-3f40-4ea9-aa2c-0df5ac34b866\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#f9f6d833-3f40-4ea9-aa2c-0df5ac34b866\" id=\"f9f6d833-3f40-4ea9-aa2c-0df5ac34b866-link\">9<\/a><\/sup>\uff01<br>Don&#8217;t worry!
