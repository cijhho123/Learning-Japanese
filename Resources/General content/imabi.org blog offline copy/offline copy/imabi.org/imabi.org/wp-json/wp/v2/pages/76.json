They represent the names of anything and everything within their definitions. For instance,&nbsp;\u6728 means &#8220;tree,&#8221; and it is used to describe any and all trees. To be more specific, you can add a modifier to the word, or you can use the specific name of the tree in question, which will also be a common noun. As an example,&nbsp;\u67f3 specifically means &#8220;willow.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mastering common nouns will be a significant part of studying kanji. While it is not necessary to learn the kanji spelling of every noun you encounter right away, it\u2019s always beneficial to familiarize yourself with how they are written. Seeing their kanji forms helps reinforce recognition and builds a deeper understanding over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>Noun<\/strong><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>&nbsp;Meaning<\/strong><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>&nbsp;Noun<\/strong><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>&nbsp;Meaning<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u9752<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Blue<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u8d64<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Red<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u79cb<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Autumn<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u671d<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Morning<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u8db3<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Foot<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u811a<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Leg<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u982d<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Head<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u5144<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Older brother<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u59c9<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Older sister<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u72ac<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Dog<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u59b9<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Younger sister<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u97f3<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Sound<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u5f1f<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Younger brother<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u5ddd<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">River<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u9ed2<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Black<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u767d<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">White<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u732b<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Cat<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u4eba<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Person<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u6c34<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Water<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u591c<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Night<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Proper Nouns\u3000<br>\u56fa\u6709\u540d\u8a5e<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as in English, proper nouns in Japanese refer to specific entities,&nbsp;such as organizations, toponyms (place names), or anything that would typically be capitalized in English.
