By the end of this lesson, you should feel more comfortable in your ability to use and understand this fascinating particle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Particle \u3066<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u3066&nbsp;<strong>connects two or more phrases<\/strong>, sometimes implicitly indicating reason. However, the action in the latter clause(s) can&#8217;t contain volition. It may also&nbsp;<strong>list actions or qualities or even indicate a method for action<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though some call the \u3066\u5f62 the Japanese &#8220;gerund&#8221;, it can&#8217;t be used as a nominal phrase, though \uff5e\u3066\u306e might make one rethink this. Even so, \uff5e\u3066\u306e is either a case of ellipsis (\u306e is in place of something) or an alternative \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 (Ex. \u4e8b\u5b9f\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8ad6\u6587\u3000VS \u4e8b\u5b9f\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u3044\u305f\u8ad6\u6587). As other names cause problems, we&#8217;ll continue to call it a conjunctive particle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to \uff5e\u305f, the same sound changes mentioned above apply to \uff5e\u3066. It&#8217;s important to note that \u3066 is generally thought to have come from the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 of the perfective auxiliary \u3064, which is now obsolete. Some dispute this, however, and claim it has always existed. This will become important to keep in mind when tense in relation to \u3066 is addressed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At times, \u3066 creates adverbial-like expressions that don&#8217;t have subjects or objects. Since the meanings of these expressions can&#8217;t simply be understood from the verbs they come from, you have to treat them as separate words. Examples include \u6539\u3081\u308b (to revise) VS \u6539\u3081\u3066 (anew), \u5f37\u3044\u308b(to coerce) VS \u5f37\u3044\u3066 (boldly). These phrases, though, will also not be the focus of this lesson.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>Examples<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u5f93\u3063\u3066\u3001\u51fa\u822a\u306f\u4e2d\u6b62\u3068\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, leaving port is suspended.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u751f\u307e\u308c\u3066\u521d\u3081\u3066\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u3092\u96e2\u308c\u305f\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I left America for the first time in my life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u6539\u3081\u3066\u3084\u308a\u306a\u304a\u3059\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; To start afresh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u5f37\u3044\u3066\uff5b\u3044\u3046\u306a\u3089\u30fb\u3044\u3048\u3070\uff5d<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; If I must say so&#8230;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Word Note<\/strong>: \u5f37\u3044\u308b\u3000\uff1d\u3000To compel. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; There are other times when an auxiliary\/supplementary verb of some kind comes after \u3066 to create a complex predicate phrase (Ex. \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u308b and \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b). Transitivity is a huge issue with these two endings. The first could result in a transitive or intransitive expression whereas the latter only results in an intransitive expression despite the verbs that it attaches to are all transitive.

However, depending on the speech modal, the tense of a \u3066 clause and the final clause don&#8217;t have to match. Consider the following.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14. \u9234\u6728\u3055\u3093\u306f\u5730\u5143\u306e\u6728\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u5bb6\u3092\u5efa\u3066\u308b\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002 (Only one interpretation)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hear that Mr. Suzuki will build a house using local lumber.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>15. \u5186\u5b50\u306f\u6628\u65e5\u51fa\u56fd\u3057\u3066\u3001 \u8a89\u306f\u660e\u65e5\u5e30\u56fd\u3057\u3066\u304f\u308b\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I heard that Maruko left the country yesterday and that Homare will return tomorrow.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maruko left the country yesterday, and I hear that Homare will return tomorrow. ??<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>16. \u3054\u4e3b\u4eba\u304c\u4ea1\u304f\u306a\u3063\u3066\u5965\u69d8\u306f\u4fdd\u967a\u91d1\u3092\u8acb\u6c42\u3059\u308b\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I heard that the husband died and the wife will claim the insurance money.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The husband died, and I heard that the wife will claim the insurance money.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider the following sentence where tense is all over the place, but due to the context, the sentence is completely fine. However, just as in English, it makes the sentence potentially unnatural. With verb deletion, however, the unnaturalness that would be expected in the sentence below doesn&#8217;t exist.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>17. \u4f38\u4e09\u306f\u660e\u5f8c\u65e5\uff08\u6255\u3063\u3066\uff09\u3001\u7f8e\u767b\u91cc\u306f\u5148\u65e5\uff08\u6255\u3063\u3066\uff09\u3001\u30bb\u30b9\u306f\u6628\u65e5\u6255\u3063\u305f\u3002&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shinzo will pay the day after tomorrow, Midori paid the other day, and Seth paid yesterday.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intonation can also change things up substantially. Just as in English, a misplaced comma and cause huge changes in meaning. This is especially so when the complex predicate phrases mentioned above get split up, and it sounds as if the final verb is part of an independent clause away from \u3066.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>18. \u5f7c\u6c0f\u306e\u65e5\u8a18\u3092\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u3001\u4ed5\u821e\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I read my boyfriend&#8217;s diary and put it away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>19. \u5f7c\u6c0f\u306e\u65e5\u8a18\u3092\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I accidentally read my boyfriend&#8217;s diary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you can&#8217;t do is conjoin things into one question that are not of a cause relationship.
