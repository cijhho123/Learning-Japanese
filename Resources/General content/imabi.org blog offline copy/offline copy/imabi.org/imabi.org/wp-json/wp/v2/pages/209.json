Adnominal adjectives are known in Japanese as \u9023\u4f53\u8a5e, which constitutes as a separate part of speech with familiar phrases such as \u3053\u306e\u30fb\u305d\u306e\u30fb\u3042\u306e as its primary examples. <br><br>In this lesson, we will be focusing on \u9023\u4f53\u8a5e which derive from \u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e, as they exhibit significant overlap with their normal adjectival iterations. Appearance-wise, the difference appears to be the choice between \/i\/ and \/na\/ after the root, but to understand how big of a difference this choice makes, let&#8217;s first, consider the following examples which utilize \u5c0f\u3055\u3044 or&nbsp;\u5c0f\u3055\u306a, both translating as &#8220;small.&#8221; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>i.&nbsp;\u5c71\u306e\u5c0f\u3055\u3044\u9ce5\u305f\u3061\u3092\u89b3\u8cde\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>I\u2019m admiring the small birds of the mountain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ii. \u3042\u306e\u5c71\u306e\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u753a\u306b\u4f4f\u3093\u3067\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>I live in the small town on that mountain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>iii.&nbsp;\u30cd\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30eb\u4eba\u306f\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u4f53\u683c\uff5b\u304c\u30fb\u306e\uff5d\uff5b\u5c0f\u3055\u3044 \u25cb\u30fb\u5c0f\u3055\u306a X\uff5d\u4eba\u7a2e\u3060\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>Were the Neanderthals really a small-build human species?<br><br>iv. \u30cd\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u4f53\u683c\u304c\u5c0f\u3055\u304b\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>Were the builds of Neanderthals actually small? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While \u5c0f\u3055\u3044 and \u5c0f\u3055\u306a are syntactically identical in i. and ii., this is not the case in iii or iv. Of the two forms, only&nbsp;\u5c0f\u3055\u3044 can be seen in the predicative form, a.k.a, the \u7d42\u6b62\u5f62, while we see that both \u5c0f\u3055\u3044 and \u5c0f\u3055\u306a are used as attributes (the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As is the case with English, nouns can be modified by more than one modifier. This is the case in i., but \u5c0f\u3055\u3044 does not constitute as subordinate clause; it is simply being used to mean &#8220;small bird&#8221;. This prevents the speaker from interpreting \u5c71\u306e\u5c0f\u3055\u3044\u9ce5\u305f\u3061 as &#8220;birds with small mountains,&#8221; but this is an important point to keep in mind. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In iii., \u5c0f\u3055\u3044 is a part of an embedded subordinate clause, which is a function that \u5c0f\u3055\u306a generally does not have. Although adnominal phrases do not inherently have the syntactic role of behaving as predicates, there are rare instances of this being broken. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>v. \uff5b\u5c0f\u3055\u3044\u30fb\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\uff08\u25b3\uff09\uff5d\u6642\u304b\u3089\u5927\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I loved it since I was little.<br><br>Motives for this include the frequency of adnominal adjectives being higher than their normal adjectival variant before nouns and the sentimental change in nuance for choosing the adnominal adjective over the normal adjectival variant. <br><br>Adnominal adjectives in many ways are just like\u00a0<em>no<\/em>-adjectives but without the ability of the copula to allow them to be modified for tense or negation. Another major difference is how adnominal adjectives typically do not float around, and when they do, the resulting sentence will sound very literary and not reflective of everyday speech. <br><br>vi. \u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u3053\u306e\u90e8\u5c4b\u3067\u8cb4\u65b9\u3092\u5f85\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002(Lyrical)<br>In this small room, I wait for you.<br><br>vii. \u3053\u306e\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u90e8\u5c4b\u3067\u3042\u306a\u305f\u3092\u5f85\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002(Typical Word Order)<br>I am waiting for you in this small room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\/i\/ &amp; \/na\/ Pairs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The syntactic differences outlined above may explain the differences between adnominal adjectives and their normal, non-adnominal adjective counterparts, but it is just as important to consider the semantic differences for when they overlap.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before getting into further detail, in the chart below you will find a list of all the essential adnominal adjectives (to the right), of which there are only three<sup data-fn=\"a2ad6778-bad0-4ee5-8ad9-ffe3f6565ec0\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#a2ad6778-bad0-4ee5-8ad9-ffe3f6565ec0\" id=\"a2ad6778-bad0-4ee5-8ad9-ffe3f6565ec0-link\">1<\/a><\/sup>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table aligncenter\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;Meaning<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9023\u4f53\u8a5e<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Small<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5c0f\u3055\u3044<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5c0f\u3055\u306a<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Large<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5927\u304d\u3044<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5927\u304d\u306a<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Strange<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u53ef\u7b11\u3057\u3044<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u53ef\u7b11\u3057\u306a<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u304b\u7d30\u3044\u58f0\u306f\u3060\u3093\u3060\u3093\u5927\u304d\u304f\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002(Use of \u5927\u304d\u3044)<br>The fragile voice is becoming gradually larger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;\u9a5a\u304f\u307b\u3069\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u7d20\u8db3\u304c\u9732\u308f\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002\u3000(Use of \u5c0f\u3055\u306a)<br>Surprisingly small bare feet became exposed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: In Ex. 2 \u5c0f\u3055\u306a is at the head of a dependent clause, but most importantly, it demonstrates how adnominal adjectives derived from adjectives may be modified by adverbs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u58f0\u3067\u8a71\u3057\u304b\u3051\u308b\u3002(Use of \u5c0f\u3055\u306a)&nbsp;<br>To talk to someone in a small voice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4.&nbsp;\u5927\u304d\u3044\u5e0c\u671b\u306e\u96f2\u304c\u6e67\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002(Use of \u5927\u304d\u3044)<br>Large clouds of hope are gushing forth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.&nbsp;\u5927\u304d\u306a\u5e0c\u671b\u306e\u96f2\u304c\u6e67\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002(Use of \u5927\u304d\u306a)<br>Clouds of great hope are gushing forth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nuance Differences<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, the use of a \/i\/-ending adjective over its adnominal adjectival counterpart is meant to be objective.
