The first thing that comes to mind when seeing these two sounds together is \u30ab\u30b9 (scum). This is a very useful insult, but leaving jokes aside, this lesson will be about a somewhat productive ending that you will inevitably come across most frequently in casual situations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of verbs with \uff5e\u304b\u3059 are rougher\/stronger phrases limited to casual contexts, but this is not the case for all of them. The frequency of this suffix depends on the dialect, but Standard Japanese has plenty of examples for us to study.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\uff5e\u304b\u3059<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When confronted with examples of verbs ending in the suffix \uff5e\u304b\u3059, some think that is a casual ending of recent origin. In reality, though, verbs with it have existed for as long as Japanese has been written down. &nbsp;The \u304b\u3059 we see appears to derive from the transitive form of \u3067\u304d\u308b, \u3067\u304b\u3059. This verb comes about from simply adding \u3059 to deki-. \u3067\u304b\u3059 is equivalent to \u3046\u307e\u304f\u3084\u308b. If speakers misinterpreted this as inserting a \u304b before \u3059, then this explains its appearance in other verb forms.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next we have the similar looking&nbsp;\u3057\u3067\u304b\u3059, which is used in almost completely contrary situations of contriving and failing. Although \u3057\u3067\u304b\u3059 is most often written as \u4ed5\u51fa\u304b\u3059 in \u6f22\u5b57, it may also be spelled as \u70ba\u51fa\u304b\u3059. The original meaning of \u3057\u3067\u304b\u3059 was \u3057(\u3044)\u3060\u3059. This verb, which still exists as \u3057\u3060\u3059, means &#8220;to start to do something&#8221;. The intransitive form of \u51fa\u3059 is \u51fa\u308b. This makes it more obvious that \u304b is what was inserted. From here, we have a motivation for inserting \u304b into other verbs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, \u304b optionally appears in transitive forms to create a rougher expression. The vulgar nature of \u30ab\u30b9 as in the noun should not be ignored as a motivation for most of the examples being rough in nature today as folk etymology can do wonders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rarely is it an integral part of the phrase in Standard Japanese, but such examples do exist (\u5bdd\u304b\u3059, \u5506\u3059). However, its appearance in a variety of words throughout the language&#8217;s dialect suggests that \u304b\u3059 has indeed been used as a rather productive ending. Whether or not it has a causative meaning or is used to simply make a transitive verb depends on the individual verb. If a verb with \u304b\u3059 has no \u81ea\u52d5\u8a5e\u5f62, it&#8217;s fair to say that the form has since disappeared.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>More&nbsp;Example Words<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u307e\u305f\u540c\u3058\u5931\u6557\u3092\u3084\u3089\u304b\u3057\u305f\u304f\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to make the same mistake again.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Word Note<\/strong>: \u9063\u3089\u304b\u3059 is a \u305e\u3093\u3056\u3044\u306a\u8a00\u3044\u65b9 for \u3084\u308b and is generally fully written in \u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a.

This appears to come from the verb \u6f64\u3059 (to moisten). \u51b7\u3084\u304b\u3059 either sounds somewhat archaic, slangish, or dialectical for the meaning of &#8220;to cool down&#8221;, but it is frequently used with the meaning &#8220;to ridicule&#8221;, undoubtedly from the original sense of the word. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u4f7f\u3044\u5206\u3051 Note<\/strong>: \u51b7\u3084\u304b\u3059 is very similar to \u304b\u3089\u304b\u3046 and \u8336\u5316\u3059.

Some think that it is from \u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u30e1\u30e9 (an oboe used at ramen stands) turned into a verb by using \u30c1\u30e3. Some think it is merely a contraction of \u8336\u3068\u5316\u3059 (to turn into something of ridicule). This use of \u8336 to mean &#8220;ridicule&#8221; comes from \u8336\u306b\u3059\u308b which started from meaning &#8220;to take a break&#8221; to &#8220;to make fun of&#8221;.
