Topicalizing a non-deictic expression often results in \u306b being dropped because the particle \u306f heightens its adverbial nature.<br>iv. When the events of the main clause are given greater semantic weight in the sentence, \u306b is often dropped. This is especially so when non-deictic expressions are in sentence-initial position and can be viewed as tacked-on information.<br>v. When the main clause describes a condition versus an action, non-deictic expressions are not used with \u306b because they are viewed as adverbs qualifying the nature of said state of being.<br><br>None of these points, however, negate the obvious fact that \u306b, \u306f, \u306b\u306f, and \u306b\u3082 are indeed used with \u3068\u304d and \u3053\u308d.
