Instead of referring to this noun as Y, it would make more sense to view it as Xi, an altered version of the original X to emphasize how special it is. The exact nature of how Xi is more special, extraordinary, or more narrow in scope than X itself depends on the context, but Xi must be very semantically close to X for the sentence to be grammatical.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>70.&nbsp;<strong>\u5317\u3082\u5317\u3001\u5317\u6d77\u9053\u306e\u6700\u5317\u306e\u679c\u3066<\/strong>\u306b\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>It is set up at the very edge of the northernmost point of Hokkaido, as north as you can get.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>71. \u3042\u3042\u3001<strong>\u8ff7\u60d1\u3082\uff08\u8ff7\u60d1\u3001\uff09\u5927\u8ff7\u60d1<\/strong>\u3060\u3002<br>Ugh, how absolutely annoying!
