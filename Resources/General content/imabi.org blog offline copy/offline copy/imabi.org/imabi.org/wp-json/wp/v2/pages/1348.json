This latter usage is shared with \u306a\u304c\u3089, which eventually replaces it altogether in the spoken&nbsp;language&nbsp;by the \u5ba4\u753a\u6642\u4ee3. You may sometimes see it combined with the perfective \u306c (\u306b\u3064\u3064). This is still used in some schools of poetry. Also be aware that this can be seen at the end of a sentence where an auxiliary like \u305f\u308a or \u308a would be to give a big emotional pull. This is seen a lot in \u548c\u6b4c.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u6625\u82b1\u80fd \u5b87\u90fd\u8def\u5e03\u9ebb\u6ce5\u5c13 \u76f8\u898b\u7962\u5a46 \u6708\u65e5\u9918\u7f8e\u90fd\u8ffd \u4f0a\u6bcd\u9ebb\u90fd\u826f\u725f\u66fd\u3000(\u539f\u6587)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; \u6625\u82b1\u306e\u3046\u3064\u308d\u3075\u307e\u3067\u306b\u76f8\u898b\u306d\u3070\u6708\u65e5\u3088\u307f\u3064\u3064\u59b9\u5f85\u3064\u3089\u3080\u305e<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Since we won\u2019t meet till the spring flowers have scattered, my wife will wait as she counts the days.<br>From the \u4e07\u8449\u96c6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u65bc\u4fdd\u5409\u5b87\u7f8e\u80fd\u3000\u7f8e\u5948\u66fd\u5df1\u5e03\u53ef\u4e45\u3000\u65bc\u6bdb\u6bd4\u90fd\u3003\u3000\u6bdb\u5a62\u4f0e\u5948\u826f\u4e4b\u601d\u3000\u9808\u6211\u6ce2\u826f\u80fd\u4f50\u5200\u3000(\u539f\u6587)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; \u5927\u304d\u6d77\u306e\u6c34\u5e95\u6df1\u304f\u601d\u3072\u3064\u3064\u88f3\u5f15\u304d\u306a\u3089\u3057\u3057\u83c5\u539f\u306e\u91cc<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh Sugawara Village with the foot of the mountains drawn and flat, I adore as deep as the bottom of &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a great sea.<br>From the \u4e07\u8449\u96c6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u91ce\u5c71\u306b\u307e\u3058\u308a\u3066\u7af9\u3092\u53d6\u308a\u3064\u3064\u3001\u3088\u308d\u3065\u306e\u4e8b\u306b\u4f7f\u3072\u3051\u308a\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Repeatedly entering the fields and hills and gathering bamboo, he used it for thousands of things.<br>From the \u7af9\u53d6\u7269\u8a9e.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u591a\u90fd\u591a\u591c\u9ebb\u3000\u898b\u90fd\u3003\u53e4\u8981\u8a31\u4e4b\u3000\u4f50\u4e45\u826f\u6ce2\u5948\u3000\u77e5\u5229\u52a0\u9808\u7591\u5948\u725f\u3000\u548c\u6211\u53ef\u655d\u6d41\u5200\u5c13\u3000(\u539f\u6587)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; \u9f8d\u7530\u5c71\u898b\u3064\u3064\u8d8a\u3048\u6765\u3057\u685c\u82b1\u6563\u308a\u304b\u904e\u304e\u306a\u3080\u308f\u304c\u5e30\u308b\u3068\u306b<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I wonder if the cherry blossoms I came to see as I cross Tatsuta Mountain will fall while I\u2019m not home.<br>From the \u4e07\u8449\u96c6.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. \u89d2\u969c\u7d4c\u3000\u3000\u3000\u77f3\u6751\u6bdb\u4e0d\u904e\u3000\u3000\u3000\u6cca\u702c\u5c71\u3000\u3000\u3000\u4f55\u6642\u6bdb\u5c06\u8d85\u3000\u3000\u3000\u591c\u8005\u6df1\u53bb\u901a\u90fd\u3000(\u539f\u6587)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; \u3064\u306e\u3055\u306f\u3075<ruby>\u78d0\u4f59<rt>\u3044\u306f\u308c<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3082\u904e\u304e\u305a\u6cca\u702c\u5c71\u3044\u3064\u304b\u3082\u8d8a\u3048\u3080\u591c\u306f\u66f4\u3051\u306b\u3064\u3064<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Still having not passed Iware, and though the night is already going to get late, I wonder when I\u2019ll &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cross Hatsuse Mountain?<br>From the \u4e07\u8449\u96c6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Word Note<\/strong>: \u3064\u306e\u3055\u306f\u3075 is an epithet word for \u78d0\u4f59.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Conjunctive Particle \u306a\u304c\u3089<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The particle \u306a\u304c\u3089 comes from the combination of the ancient attribute marker \u306a, which is still seen fossilized in some words such as \u6c34\u5e95 from above, and \u304b\u3089, which was once a noun as has been demonstrated from passages from the \u4e07\u8449\u96c6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like \u3064\u3064, it can be used to show simultaneous action, but in doing so it might also show a concessive connection.&nbsp;\u306a\u304c\u3089 can and does follow nominals often.
