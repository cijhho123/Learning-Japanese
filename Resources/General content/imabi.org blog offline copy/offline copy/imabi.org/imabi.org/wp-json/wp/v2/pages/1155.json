Sometimes, dialects of the same language can differ in how punctuation operates, especially the use of commas and periods. Punctuation marks (\u7d04\u7269) also exist in Japanese, but unlike so many languages, there are no concrete guidelines that govern how punctuation should operate. In fact, it is hardly ever a talking point in Japanese language studies (\u56fd\u8a9e) in schooling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the modern era, text (\u6587\u7ae0) is viewed as being made up of sentences (\u6587), which form phrases (\u6587\u7bc0) that then form paragraphs (\u6bb5\u843d). While this basic framework in which punctuation operates may seem universal, this is not the case whatsoever.<br><br>What even defines a word (\u5358\u8a9e) is not universally constant, so the combination of words in a logical fashion, then, is necessarily dictated by what is deemed logical within individual language communities. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the context of Japanese, words are heavily modified, especially those which function as predicates. This characteristic, along with its script being a mixed system of logograms and syllabaries, has resulted in spacing (\u5206\u304b\u3061\u66f8\u304d) itself largely being absent, as spaces (\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9) would be limited to where divides would not break up unbreakable chains. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the most basic punctuation marks in English &#8211; the period (.), comma (,) and question mark (?) &#8211; are functionally redundant in Japanese grammar, with the period&#8217;s function being covered by the \u7d42\u6b62\u5f62, the comma being covered by conjunctive particles (\u63a5\u7d9a\u52a9\u8a5e) or the \u9023\u7528\u5f62, and the question mark being covered by the particle \u304b.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even once we have what can be defined as a paragraph, English and Japanese still do not meet eye to eye. There are two forms of paragraphing present in Japanese, with one arguably mirroring the way paragraphs are formed in the English-speaking world:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>\u610f\u5473\u6bb5\u843d: A chunk of text that constitutes one meaning=thought.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u5f62\u5f0f\u6bb5\u843d: Several sentences that could stand as individual thoughts, and thus their own paragraphs, but are consolidated into one block to paint a bigger picture.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Of these styles, \u610f\u5473\u6bb5\u843d describes how the majority of Japanese text is structured, with \u5f62\u5f0f\u6bb5\u843d matching what English readers are more accustomed to seeing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this lesson, we will study the various punctuation marks that are in use in Modern Japanese, with some even being unique to Japanese. While the use of some marks may not be as rule-bound as their English equivalents, punctuation still provides a rich layer of nuancing power, and there are still generalizations that can be studied to help you, as a learner, to use them in Japanese-like fashion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another very important preface to make is that while punctuation is not as rigidly codified in Japanese as it is in other standardized languages, it is also not a free-for-all as is purported by educators, natives, and learners alike. To approach punctuation as objectively as possible, real life examples as well as citations from the Ministry of Culture&#8217;s (\u6587\u5316\u5e81) most recent attempt at punctuation guidelines\u2014\u516c\u7528\u6587\u4f5c\u6210\u306e\u8003\u3048\u65b9\uff08\u5efa\u8b70\uff09(2022)\u2014will be incorporated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Period: \u53e5\u70b9\u30fb\u307e\u308b<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The formal means of referring to the period in Japanese is the \u53e5\u70b9, but depending on whether you are referring to the English period (.) or the Japanese period (\u3002), the typical naming convention will pivot toward \u30d4\u30ea\u30aa\u30c9 and \u307e\u308b respectively. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, the Japanese period \u3002is used in both horizontal and vertical text, following a norm established during the Meiji Restoration. However, a Western-adopted alteration of the English &#8220;.&#8221; &#8211; its full-width variant \uff0ehas been present in predominantly horizontal text in varying capacities. While attempts to restrict the Japanese variety to vertical text and the Western variety to horizontal text have been made, even in official documentation, in reality, the Western \uff0ehas hardly seen use, to the point that as of 2022, \u3002has become the default period in official use<sup data-fn=\"ac6d3af3-4a3a-4300-9cc3-e99531e3d73f\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#ac6d3af3-4a3a-4300-9cc3-e99531e3d73f\" id=\"ac6d3af3-4a3a-4300-9cc3-e99531e3d73f-link\">1<\/a><\/sup>. <br><br>In English and Japanese, periods denote the end of a statement and\/or sentence, even when the statement\/sentence is inverted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u5927\u96e8\u306e\u5f71\u97ff\u3067\u4e09\u91cd\u770c\u5185\u3067\u306f\u6851\u540d\u5e02\u3067\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u3068\u3082\uff17\u68df\u306e\u4f4f\u5b85\u304c\u3001\u83f0\u91ce\u753a\u3067\uff11\u68df\u304c\u5e8a\u4e0a\u307e\u3067\u6c34\u306b\u3064\u304b\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>Due to the effect of heavy rain there are 7 houses at least in Kuwana City inside Mie Prefecture and one house in Komono Town where they are submerged in water above floor level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u6765\u305f\u3001\u6765\u305f\u3001\u3042\u306e\u732b\u304c\u3002<br>It came, it came, that cat.<br><br>4. \u304a\u3044\u3057\u3044\u3001\u3053\u308c\u3002<br>This is delicious.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, Japanese, especially when paragraphing norms mean that nothing immediately follows, full stops are not always present, and it is not the case that the presence of tacked-on text in paragraphs affects the lack of a period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. \u3053\u306e\u3053\u3068\u306f\u3001\u3059\u3067\u306b\u7b2c\u56db\u7ae0\u3067\u8aac\u660e\u3057\u305f\uff08\u516d\u5341\u4e03\u9801\u53c2\u7167)&nbsp;<br>This is already explained in Chapter 4 (See Pg. 67)&nbsp;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.

This is because the use of any form of quotation mark, parentheses, etc. used in Japanese is entirely avoided in mainstream Japanese learning textbooks<sup data-fn=\"1d6e8823-a1d4-4d35-af1d-c048304ff7ad\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#1d6e8823-a1d4-4d35-af1d-c048304ff7ad\" id=\"1d6e8823-a1d4-4d35-af1d-c048304ff7ad-link\">2<\/a><\/sup>.

We also see how the sentence-initial adverb \u3082\u3057 is accompanied with a \u3001, which is similar to how &#8220;&#8230;&#8221; is used in the English translation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, pauses also occur after the \u7d42\u6b62\u5f62, as its purpose is to mark the end of an independent clause.

In doing so, \u3060 encompasses the meaning of [\u3053\u3046\u3044\u3046\u3053\u3068\u306b\u53b3\u3057\u3044\u304b\u3089].<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all fairness, this does happen to an extent in English, if one is willing to allow loose adherence to the rule that ALL independent clauses must end in a period.<br><br>iv.

Granted, the particle \u3066 happens to be highly sensitive to context in how it is interpreted, but those relationships can still be found within complex modifiers due to Japanese allowing sentences of any length and complexity to be morphed into a modifier.<br><br>In the spoken language, punctuation naturally does not exist, which begs the question how speakers discern these boundaries, so much so that when it comes down to putting things to paper, this all begs the question whether \u3001correspond to natural divisions divided on semantic lines or simply to pauses (and from there discerning what the pauses indicate). In reality, both cases are true, and how the spoken language facilitates all this is via intonation. Arguably, it is the written language that makes structural ambiguity so apparent for the very reason that we cannot hear how the sentence was uttered, robbing us of all the verbalized cues that would have deleted most ambiguity that would arise on paper. <br><br>Be that as it may, we are forced to limit our discussion to the written language and the textualized rendition of the spoken language. <br><br>45&#8242;. \u4e8c\u91cd\u306b\u66f2\u3052\u3066\u3001\u9996\u306b\u61f8\u3051\u308b\u6570\u73e0\u3002<br>A rosary that is double layered and worn around the neck.<br><br>It also goes without saying that there was a subtle issue of ambiguity in Ex. 45 caused by spelling \u9996 as \u304f\u3073 in which the use of kanji would alleviate said ambiguity.
