This was first pointed out by the linguist \u6709\u5742\u79c0\u4e16 in his work \u300e\u4e0a\u4ee3\u306b\u65bc\u3051\u308b\u30b5\u884c\u306e\u982d\u97f3\u300f, and the discovery was made thanks to research into the reconstruction of Chinese pronunciations<sup data-fn=\"c60d7371-bc72-4a6f-9416-96c1908b7c88\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#c60d7371-bc72-4a6f-9416-96c1908b7c88\" id=\"c60d7371-bc72-4a6f-9416-96c1908b7c88-link\">1<\/a><\/sup> at the time and how approximations for Japanese at the time seemed to indicate the lack of an \/s\/ phoneme. <br><br>By the start of the early Heian Period, however, it is also widely accepted that the \/*ts\/ phoneme of Proto-Japanese had transitioned to \/s\/, with the allophonic variant [*\u0255] appearing before \/i\/ and \/e\/. <br><br>While the palatalization of \/s\/ before \/i\/ is maintained in Modern Japanese, it may come off as strange that \u30bb was once pronounced likewise as [\u0255e]. However, thanks to transliterations found in Kirishitan Japanese-Portuguese (\u65e5\u8461\u8f9e\u66f8) dictionary inscriptions of the pronunciations found in Middle Japanese that it was indeed pronounced as so, and still is in many Western Japanese dialects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\/s\/ \u2192 \/h\/<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a universal tendency for \/s\/ to transition to \/h\/ over the course of natural language change. As such, its appearance in Japanese is not be surprising. Yet, its appearance in Japanese remains dialectal with varying social implications. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One such commonly held belief is that the pronunciation of \/s\/ as [h] is reflective of &#8216;lazy&#8217; speech. While sound changes are often thought of as being motivated by easing articulation, sounds naturally drift in their qualities over time, and pinpointing exactly why a specific sound change occurs is rather difficult. As such, the assertion that pronouncing \/s\/ as [h] is a reflection of a natural sound change of \/s\/ to \/h\/ and NOT a reflection of lazy speech. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Examples By Dialect<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A general <em>tendency<\/em> across Japanese dialects is that \/s\/ \u2192 \/h\/ is most prominent in non-Eastern Japanese dialects. In Eastern Japanese dialects, the opposite phenomenon in which \/h\/ manifests as [s] in most contexts may be observed. However, when \/s\/ is not palatalized, retention of [\u0255] with \/e\/ may appear in both regions in older populations. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td>\u6a19\u6e96\u8a9e<\/td><td>\u975e\u6a19\u6e96\u8a9e\u306e\u767a\u97f3<\/td><td>Meaning<\/td><td>\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u308b\u65b9\u8a00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\uff5e\u307e\u305b\u3093<\/td><td>\uff5e\u307e\u3078\u3093<\/td><td>Polite negation<\/td><td>\u897f\u65e5\u672c\u65b9\u8a00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u305d\u308c\u306a\u3089<\/td><td>\u307b\u3093\u306a\u3089<\/td><td>If so<\/td><td>\u897f\u65e5\u672c\u65b9\u8a00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\uff5e\u3055\u3093<\/td><td>\uff5e\u306f\u3093<\/td><td>Honorific suffix<\/td><td>\u897f\u65e5\u672c\u65b9\u8a00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u6368\uff08\u3059\uff09\u3066\u308b<\/td><td>\u6368\uff08\u3075\uff09\u3066\u308b<\/td><td>To throw away<\/td><td>\u897f\u65e5\u672c\u65b9\u8a00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u5e03\u56e3\u3092\u6577\uff08\u3057\uff09\u304f<\/td><td>\u5e03\u56e3\u3092\u6577\uff08\u3072\uff09\u304f<\/td><td>To lay out a futon<\/td><td>\u897f\u65e5\u672c\u65b9\u8a00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u8cea\u5c4b\uff08\u3057\u3061\u3084\uff09<\/td><td>\u8cea\u5c4b\uff08\u3072\u3061\u3084\uff09<\/td><td>Pawn shop<\/td><td>\u897f\u65e5\u672c\u65b9\u8a00<br>\u6c5f\u6238\u5f01<br>\u4e5d\u5dde\u65b9\u8a00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u304a\u4e03\u591c\uff08\u3057\u3061\u3084\uff09<\/td><td>\u304a\u4e03\u591c\uff08\u3072\u3061\u3084\uff09<\/td><td>Name-giving ceremony<\/td><td>\u897f\u65e5\u672c\u65b9\u8a00<br>\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5f01<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u4e03\u5b97\u753a<\/td><td>\u4e03\u5b97\u753a<\/td><td>Hichis\u014d Town<\/td><td>\u5730\u540d<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u51b7\u3084\u3063\u3053\u3044<\/td><td>\u3057\u3083\u3063\u3053\u3044<\/td><td>Cold<\/td><td>\u6771\u65e5\u672c\u65b9\u8a00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u6771\uff08\u3072\u304c\u3057\uff09<\/td><td>\u6771\uff08\u3057\u304c\u3057\uff09<\/td><td>East<\/td><td>\u6771\u65e5\u672c\u65b9\u8a00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u5148\u751f<\/td><td>\u5148\u751f\uff08\u3078\u3093\u3078\uff09<\/td><td>Teacher<\/td><td>\u6d25\u8efd\u5f01<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u5148\u751f<\/td><td>\u5148\u751f\uff08\u3057\u3047\u3093\u3057\u3047\u3044\uff09<\/td><td>Teacher<\/td><td>\u535a\u591a\u5f01<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u6577\u304f vs \u5f15\u304f<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the examples mentioned above, the one that is perhaps the most fascinating is the pronunciation of \u6577\u304f.
