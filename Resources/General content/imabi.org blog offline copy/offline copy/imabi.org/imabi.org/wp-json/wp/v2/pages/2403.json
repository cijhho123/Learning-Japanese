To an English speaker, describing a supposition as hearsay may ironically lessen the credibility, but this is not the case with \uff5e\u3089\u3057\u3044.

For that reason, the certainty behind Ex. 3 is less than Ex. 2. <br><br>Because \uff5e\u3089\u3057\u3044 is characterized by suppositions based on hearsay of the overall scene at hand, it should not be used in contexts concerning people&#8217;s situations out of the picture. <br><br>4a. \u30c6\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u541b\u306f\u4eca\u9803\u306f\u98ef\u3067\u3082\u98df\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3060\u308d\u3046\u3002\u3007<br>4b. \u30c6\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u541b\u306f\u4eca\u9803\u306f\u98ef\u3067\u3082\u98df\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3089\u3057\u3044\u3002X<br>Taylor is probably eating right about now.<br><br>As for how \uff5e\u3089\u3057\u3044 contrasts with \uff5e\u305d\u3046\u3060, which also marks hearsay, consider the following:<br><br>5a. \u30c6\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u541b\u306f\u3001\u9178\u3063\u3071\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3092\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3044\u3089\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>Taylor apparently wants to eat something sour.<br><br>5b. \u30c6\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u541b\u306f\u3001\u9178\u3063\u3071\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3092\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3044\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>I hear Taylor wants to eat something sour. <br><br>As opposed to \u7d42\u6b62\u5f62\uff0b\uff5e\u305d\u3046\u3060, the speaker may be seen as indifferent to the validity of the statement when using \uff5e\u3089\u3057\u3044.

Because \uff5e\u307f\u305f\u3044\u3060 is a relatively new ending in terms of Japanese grammar &#8211; having originated from \uff5e\u898b\u305f\u3088\u3046\u3060 &#8211; it is still deemed to be less formal than \uff5e\u3088\u3046\u3060.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\uff5e\u3089\u3057\u3044 may also express typicality, as in, striking similarity. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. \u3053\u306e\u7d75\u753b\u306f\u672c\u7269\uff08\u3067\u3042\u308b\uff09\u3089\u3057\u3044\u3002<br>This painting is apparently the real one.<br><br>7. \u3053\u306e\u7d75\u753b\u306f\u672c\u7269\u3088\u308a\u3082\u672c\u7269\u3089\u3057\u3044\u3002<br>This painting is more worthy of being the real one than the actual real one.<br><br>Notice how in Ex. 6, \uff5e\u3089\u3057\u3044 feels more like an auxiliary because of how it marks supposition, whereas in Ex. 7 \uff5e\u3089\u3057\u3044 instead acts as an adjectival suffix marking likeness.
