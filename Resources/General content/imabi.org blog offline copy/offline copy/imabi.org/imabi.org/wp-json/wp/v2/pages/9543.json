entirely limited to these Y elements. Consider the following.<br><br>16. \u30e1\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u306f\u30b5\u30e9\u30c0\u3060\u3051\u3068\u4f4e\u30ab\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc\u3002<br>The menu is low-calorie, consisting only of salad. <br><br>17. \u9078\u624b\u305f\u3061\u306f\u65e9\u304f\u3082\u6298\u308a\u8fd4\u3057\u70b9\u3068\u98db\u3070\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002<br>The athletes are zooming ahead, raising to get to the halfway point as quickly as possible.  <br><br>18. \u30b7\u30e3\u30c4\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30ba\u306fXXL\u3068\u7279\u5927\u3002<br>The size of the shirt(s) is massive (XXL).<br><br>Even so, we see that Y is still a noun that can be viewed as an entity which serves as the gauge for the following predicate, but the relationship is notably more analytical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One mistake that often arises from learners upon being exposed to sentences like Exs. 16-18 is the recurrence of overextending \u3068 to blindly connect two predicates in the sense of &#8220;and.&#8221; This is not without reason, though. Upon close inspection of Exs. 11-18, we see that Y is a dependent clause exactly how we saw it used in Lesson 74 (also yet another reason why this usage still counts as the quotative \u3068). First, let&#8217;s look at two incorrect sentences. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>19a. \u30c0\u30cb\u30a8\u30eb\u3055\u3093\u306f\u30ce\u30eb\u30a6\u30a7\u30fc\u51fa\u8eab\u3068\u8272\u304c\u767d\u3044\u3002X<br>19b. \u30c0\u30cb\u30a8\u30eb\u3055\u3093\u306f\u30ce\u30eb\u30a6\u30a7\u30fc\u51fa\u8eab\u3067\u8272\u304c\u767d\u3044\u3002\u3007<br>Daniel is Norwegian and is fair-skinned. <br><br>20a. \u30bb\u30b9\u3055\u3093\u306f\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u3068\u82f1\u8a9e\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002X<br>20b. \u30bb\u30b9\u3055\u3093\u306f\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u3067\u3001\u82f1\u8a9e\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3007<br>Seth-san is American and can speak English.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The semantic reason for why these sentences are invalid is that the Y component being attributed to \u3068 cannot be attributed to a scale of some sort. There is no gradient in one&#8217;s nationality. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syntactically, we can also see that the dependent clause attempted to be formed in Exs. 19-20 are not the same in nature as the ones found in Exs. 16-18. As Exs. 16-17 particularly show, the tacking on of other adverbial components makes it all the more evident that the dependent clauses at hand are not separate thoughts but complements to the independent clause, whereas in Exs. 19-20, the dependent clause in each could just as easily been phrased as its own sentence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The objectivity of the quotative \u3068 and the subjectivity of the predicate, as has held true thus far in our coverage of \u3068 also has a consequence in word order that may not be otherwise evident if not for mistakes. Consider the following.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>21a. \u682a\u4fa1\u306f\u53cd\u843d\u3068\uff11\uff10\uff10\uff10\u5186\uff01X<br>21b. \u682a\u4fa1\u306f\uff11\uff10\uff10\uff10\u5186\u3068\u53cd\u843d\uff01\u3007<br>Intended: The stock price fell to 1,000 yen! <br><br>As a core feature of the quotative \u3068, its objective substance must be presented first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in Lesson 74, we saw the following example to demonstrate how some instances of Y may or may not represent the same action as the predicate but that, at the end of the day, that detail is not so meaningful given the synonymous outcome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>52. \u935b\u51b6\u5c4b\u306e\u4f5c\u696d\u54e1\u306f\u3001\u3084\u3063\u3068\u4fee\u7406\u304c\u3067\u304d\u305f\u306e\u3060\u3068\u559c\u3093\u3067\u3044\u305f\u3002<br>The blacksmith worker rejoiced that he had finally repaired it.<br>\u201cI finally repaired it!\u201d the blacksmith worker rejoiced.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out, this blurred syntactic role of \u3068 bleeds into understanding the facet of \u3068 we are looking at here.

[\u30ad\u30ce\u30b3\u3068\u6817\u3068\u30ad\u30e5\u30a6\u30ea\uff08\u3068\uff09]\u304c\u4e26\u3093\u3067\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3000\u3000<br>Mushrooms, chestnuts, and cucumbers are lined up.<br><br>25. \u30ad\u30ce\u30b3\u3001\u6817\u3001\u30ad\u30e5\u30a6\u30ea\u3068[\u79cb\u306e\u5473\u899a]\u304c\u4e26\u3093\u3067\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>With mushrooms, chestnuts, and cucumbers, the flavors of autumn are lined up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, we see several differences, the first being where \u3068 appears. As the parallel particle (meaning &#8220;and&#8221;), we see that it follows the pattern &#8220;Noun<sub>1<\/sub> \u3068 Noun<sub>n<\/sub>(\u3068)&#8221; but that as the quotative particle, it follows the pattern &#8220;Nominal<sub>1<\/sub>, Nominal<sub>n<\/sub>\u3068 (\u203b)&#8221;<br><br>\u203bThe word &#8220;nominal&#8221; is used in place of &#8220;noun&#8221; to reflect how &#8220;things&#8221; can stand for other predicate types (See Ex. 30 below). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second noticeable difference is what constitutes the subject, conveniently denoted in []. In Ex. 24, the statement is simply about the three items being lined up, but in Ex. 25, the speaker mentions [\u30ad\u30ce\u30b3\u3001\u6817\u3001\u30ad\u30e5\u30a6\u30ea], but what implied meaning these three examples enumerated by the terminal \u3068 collectively provide is only made clear by looking at the predicate, at which point it becomes clear that they are being mentioned to emphasize the theme of &#8220;autumn foods.&#8221; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ex. 25 inherently has much in common with the previous applications of the quotative \u3068, but for it to enumerate &#8220;matters at hand&#8221; hand that prop up the substantive nature of the predicate, then there MUST be more than one example mentioned. This is inherent in the idea of &#8220;enumerating.&#8221; Meaning, the following adaptation is consequently ungrammatical.<br><br>26. \u30ad\u30ce\u30b3\u3068\u79cb\u306e\u5473\u899a\u304c\u4e26\u3093\u3067\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002X<br>Intended: With mushrooms, the flavors of autumn are lined up. ???<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also worth noting that the predicate itself implies that there are multiple referents. Also, if &#8220;things&#8221; are lined up, stating that &#8220;one thing is lined up&#8221; makes no sense to begin with. Conversely, for this enumerating power of the quotative \u3068 to have its effect of emphasizing the plurality of the predicate, explicitly stating quantity for the purpose of enumeration should not occur within said predicate, for that would result in \u3068 forfeiting its role to the predicate, but the enumerated examples marked by \u3068 may be summarized with a quantity in the predicate, in which they would go hand in hand, much like all other instances of the the quotative \u3068. To visualize this, consider the following.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>27a. \u304a\u6d12\u843d\u306a\u4eba\u3005\u306e\u9593\u3067\u306f\u3001\u5c0f\u7c8b\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u3001\u8c4a\u5bcc\u306a\u8272\u67c4\u3001\u305d\u3057\u3066\u624b\u9803\u306a\u4fa1\u683c\u3068\u4e09\u62cd\u5b50\u63c3\u3063\u305f\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u3068\u3057\u3066\u77e5\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3007<br>Among stylish people, it is a brand known for its triad of traits: its chic designs, a wide range of colors and patterns, and its affordable prices.<br><br>27b. \u304a\u6d12\u843d\u306a\u4eba\u3005\u306e\u9593\u3067\u306f\u3001\u5c0f\u7c8b\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u3001\u4e09\u62cd\u5b50\u63c3\u3063\u305f\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u3068\u3057\u3066\u77e5\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002X<br>Intended: Among stylish people, it is a brand known for its triad of traits: like its chic designs. X<br><br>Ex. 27 utilizes the expression \u4e09\u62cd\u5b50\u63c3\u3063\u305f, an idiomatic expression which can roughly translate to &#8220;triple threat\/meeting all three important conditions&#8221; as the predicate for the quotative \u3068 which precedes it. Not stating what those three key things are via \u3068 defeats the purpose of the predicate, thus resulting in 27b. being ungrammatical. In fact, this also indicates that the &#8220;amount information&#8221; must be consistent throughout the sentence. Meaning, the predicate cannot indicate a different number of referents than those enumerated by \u3068 and vice versa. This also clearly delineates the quotative \u3068 from parallel particles like \u3084\u30fb\u306a\u3069 which do not have this requirement and oppositely imply that the &#8220;real number&#8221; of referents is larger. <br><br>Speaking of the parallel particle \u3068, we also see how in Ex. 27 that it can coexist inside the dependent clause marked by the quotative \u3068, indicating additional overlap between the two entities, making it clear within the mind of the speaker that whatever is enumerated is specifically what is being enumerated\u2014nothing more, nothing less.<br><br>There are still two contingencies left to look at with this use of the quotative \u3068:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>When a sequency is implied in the &#8220;things&#8221; enumerated with the quotative \u3068.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>When the &#8220;things&#8221; are not nouns but other predicate types\u2014all of which enumerate the dynamics of a &#8220;situation.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, there is a natural order to the &#8220;things&#8221; enumerated by the quotative \u3068, and the logic behind that ordering becomes apparent once the full picture is provided.

Each &#8220;complementary&#8221; verbal clause could be stated individually with no change in meaning and with nothing else implied.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>36a. \u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u304c\u767a\u751f\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3001\u76f8\u624b\u306f\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u30cd\u30b8\u304c\u7de9\u3093\u3060\u308a\u3001\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u304c\u5207\u308c\u305f\u308a<\/span><mark style=\"background-color:#e1dfdc\" class=\"has-inline-color\">\u3068<\/mark>\u76ee\u306b\u898b\u3048\u308b\u308f\u3051\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3060\u3002<br>Since we are dealing with software, even if problems arise, (the issues at hand) are not things that one can see\u2014screws coming loose, fuses blowing, the sort. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, similarly to the previous usage of the quotative \u3068, though plurality is not so inherent with \uff5e\u305f\u308a in this application, giving one instance as an &#8220;example&#8221; and implying other instances is unnatural but certainly not unheard of.

If, in the context of what aspects about a show provide good vibes, then it would be Type 3, implying a duplicity of factors that are inherent to being in the state of [\u3044\u3044\u611f\u3058].<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disambiguating Atypical Quotative \u3068 from its Typical Counterpart <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentioned way back in Lesson 74, we learned how sometimes, the citation verb can be omitted with instances of the &#8220;typical&#8221; quotative \u3068. In that lesson, examples of this occurring were only shown for when the citation verb happens to be the predicate of the main clause. The reason for this is that this omission (ellipsis) can also occur mid-sentence:<br><br>42. \u606f\u5b50\u304c\u4f1a\u793e\u3078\u884c\u304f\u3068\uff08\u8a00\u3063\u3066\uff09\u3001\u51fa\u304b\u3051\u305f\u304d\u308a\u3001\u623b\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002<br>My son has not returned since leaving &#8220;to go to his work.&#8221; <br><br>In such cases, the instance of the typical quotative \u3068 and its citation verb (predicate) form one large dependent clause. The consequence is that such examples make the typical quotative \u3068 look like the &#8220;atypical&#8221; version of the quotative \u3068. The difference is, however, that even with the citation verb omitted, its presence can always be identified, whereas with the &#8220;atypical&#8221; quotative \u3068, no verb is being omitted, per se, even for the complex sentences seen with Type 3~Type 4.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>43a. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u53e3\u3092\u958b\u3051\u9589\u3081\u3059\u308b\u3068\u304d\u3060\u3051<\/span><mark style=\"background-color:#e1dfdc\" class=\"has-inline-color\">\u3068<\/mark>\u9650\u3063\u305f\u52d5\u4f5c\u3067\u75db\u3080\u308f\u3051\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>It sounds as though the pain is not limited to when (the patient) opens\/closes their mouth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Ex. 43a, \u3068 is actually the typical quotative \u3068, as \u9650\u308b functions as a citation verb.
