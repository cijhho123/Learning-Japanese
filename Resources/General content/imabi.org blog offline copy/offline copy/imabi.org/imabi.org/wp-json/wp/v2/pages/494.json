More so than not, it may be the case that \u4e8b is being used not as a dummy noun but with its literal meaning of &#8220;thing,&#8221; but as can be deduced from Ex. 2, the two interpretations should be perceived as bridging contexts in either direction. Likewise, the particle \u306e could be used to create a pronoun with the meaning of &#8220;one,&#8221; and using \u306e in a purely &#8220;nominalizing&#8221; manner is restricted to specific grammatical contexts, such as with the ending \uff5e\u306e\u3060 or in an embedded clause like in \uff5e\u3068\u3044\u3046\u306e. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u65b0\u3057\u3044<\/span><strong>\u3053\u3068<\/strong><br>i.

As a primary example of this, we have the difference between \u9759\u304b\u3055 and \u9759\u3051\u3055. Both phrases involve the adjectival stem \/<em>shidzu<\/em>-\/, but while the former comes from \u9759\u304b\u3060, an adjectival noun meaning &#8220;to be quiet,&#8221; the latter comes from \u9759\u3051\u3057, an adjective meaning &#8220;to be calm,&#8221; which has since fallen out of use. Ultimately, \u9759\u304b\u3055 refers to the &#8220;(degree) of quietness,&#8221; while \u9759\u3051\u3055 refers to &#8220;serenity\/calm.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>18. \u307e\u308b\u3067\u5d50\u306e\u524d\u306e\u9759\u3051\u3055\u3060\u306d\u3002<br>It&#8217;s the lull before the storm.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>19. \u3042\u307e\u308a\u306e\u90e8\u5c4b\u306e\u9759\u304b\u3055\u306b\u97f3\u697d\u3092\u305a\u3063\u3068\u304b\u3051\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3068\u3057\u3093\u3069\u304f\u306a\u308b\u3002<br>Extreme quiet in a room becomes harder to deal with when you haven&#8217;t had music playing the whole time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While \uff5e\u3055 is heavily used, not every word starting with an adjectival morpheme that then happens to also end in \/-sa\/ is an example of it. A great example of such a false friend is the word \u5927\u3052\u3055, which is incidentally an adjectival noun meaning &#8220;grandiose.&#8221; Etymologically, it is quite unique, deriving from \u5927- and \u8888\u88df (from \u8888\u88df\u61f8\u3051 meaning &#8220;slashing someone diagonally from the shoulders&#8221;). As nouns made with the affix \uff5e\u3055 are nouns, we can tell from the presence of \u306a in Ex. 20 that is not one and the same.<br><br>20. \u5927\u8888\u88df\u306a\u6f14\u6280\u3092\u63a7\u3048\u76ee\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u306e\u304c\u597d\u5370\u8c61\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>Their keeping exaggerated acting to a minimal left a good impression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a case-by-case basis, depending on whether an adjectival noun can, in fact, also be used as a noun, \uff5e\u3055 may not be grammatical necessary. For this to be the case, the use of the word itself needs to be concrete enough not to warrant implying a degree to whatever quality is described by the noun. In Ex. 21, we see that \u7121\u9244\u7832 by itself can mean &#8220;reckless behavior.&#8221; Compare this with \u7121\u9244\u7832\u3055 in Ex. 22, which translates as &#8220;recklessness.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>21. \u89aa\u8b72\u308a\u306e\u7121\u9244\u7832\u3067\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u6642\u304b\u3089\u640d\u3070\u304b\u308a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002<br>He inherited his reckless behavior and has only suffered from it since he was a child.<br>From\u300e\u574a\u3061\u3083\u3093\u300fby \u590f\u76ee\u6f31\u77f3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>22. \u6b66\u592b\u541b\u306e\u3042\u307e\u308a\u306e\u7121\u9244\u7832\u3055\u306b\u5446\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002<br>I&#8217;m astonished at Takeo-kun&#8217;s excessive recklessness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Ex. 21 was an example of \uff5e\u3055 not being grammatically necessary, Ex. 23 is an example of \uff5e\u3055 not necessarily being the most natural word choice, which is not the same thing as being ungrammatical. At times, another wording may be more natural, and here we see that \uff5e\u6027, which is heavily used with Sino-Japanese vocabulary, is oftentimes more prevalent to match the tone of the sentence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>23. \u571f\u5730\u306e\u5024\u6bb5\u306f\u9762\u7a4d\u3084\uff5b\u5229\u4fbf\u6027 \u25ce\u30fb\u5229\u4fbf\u3055 \u3007\u30fb\u4fbf\u5229\u3055 \u25b3\uff5d\u306a\u3069\u306e\u8981\u56e0\u3067\u7570\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>The price of land changes due to factors such as square measure, convenience, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oddly enough, both \u5229\u4fbf and \u4fbf\u5229 are Sino-Japanese adjectival-nouns, but they differ in speech register. The former is used in rather formal contexts and also seldom heard in isolation, whereas the latter is far more prolifically used in everyday speech. This is the primary factor as to why \u4fbf\u5229\u3055 is marked as \u25b3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\uff5e\u307f<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas the affix \uff5e\u3055 is the basic means of turning an adjective\/adjectival noun into a standalone noun, a noun which notably pertains to degree by nature, the affix \uff5e\u307f serves the same grammatical function of nominalization for adjectives and adjectival nouns, but its scope is limited.
