In Modern Japanese, the overwhelming majority of these phrases can be neatly referred to as a proximal (\u8fd1\u79f0), a mesioproximal (\u4e2d\u79f0), a&nbsp;distal (\u9060\u79f0), or an indefinite (\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79f0) demonstrative that will start with the corresponding initial-mora for said category &#8211; \/ko\/, \/so\/, \/a\/, and \/do\/ in that order.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though these terms may be rather technical, as an advanced Japanese learner, you should have a fairly strong understanding of when to distinguish the various sets of demonstratives and how they relate to place, people, and time depending on the situation. Think of, for instance, how \u3053\u3061\u3089 can refer to oneself, someone in one&#8217;s in-group, or quite literally &#8220;this direction (which is closest to the speaker), and all of this is made possible by the phrase&#8217;s inherent directionality.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even into the present day, however, other demonstratives which never quite expanded into the same array of expressions persist, although they are always parallel to a corresponding directionality.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get things started, let&#8217;s look at how the basic demonstratives of Japanese would have been listed just a century ago.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Curriculum Note<\/strong>: This lesson will later be moved into a more advanced division of IMABI planned for launch in 2023.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;\u8fd1\u79f0<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;\u4e2d\u79f0<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;\u9060\u79f0<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79f0<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Thing<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3053\u308c\u30fb\u3053\u306e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305d\u308c\u30fb\u305d\u306e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3042\u308c\u30fb\u3042\u306e\u304b\u308c\u30fb\u304b\u306e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3044\u3065\u308c<br>\u3069\u308c<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Place<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3053\u3053<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305d\u3053<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3042\u305d\u3053\uff0f\u3042\u3059\u3053\u30fb\u304b\u3057\u3053&nbsp;\u304b\u306a\u305f<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3044\u3065\u3053\u30fb\u3044\u3065\u304f<br>\u3069\u3053<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Direction<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3053\u306a\u305f&nbsp;\u3053\u3061<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305d\u306a\u305f&nbsp;\u305d\u3061<\/td><td>\u3042\u306a\u305f\u30fb\u304b\u306a\u305f&nbsp;<br>\u3042\u3061<\/td><td>\u3044\u3065\u304b\u305f\uff1e\u3069\u306a\u305f<br>&nbsp;\u3044\u3065\u3061\uff1e\u3069\u3061<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adjectival Forms<\/strong>: Forms ending in \u306e are understood to be adjectival renditions of the base demonstrative in question.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of these words will be familiar, but stark differences accumulate in the columns to the right.
