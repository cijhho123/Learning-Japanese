However, both X and Y must be someone\/something that displays willful action. If the person or &#8220;it&#8221; does not have the inherent free will to not do the role provided in context, the sentence becomes invalid. 44a is given ??? along with X because grammatically is iffy when dealing with infants. It is unclear whether you can have a baby make the conscious choice to walk for your benefit. It&#8217;s also not completely far-fetched. 44b, though, is undoubtedly wrong as the agent is non-human. Personification can certainly change things, but there is no personification in this example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that A is an action with a benefit to Y, and there is usually a cost (not necessarily in the fiscal sense). Even when there&nbsp;isn&#8217;t a&nbsp;cost, something balances the situation out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between X and Y there is a sense of responsibility. The action that is requested by Y to X is from a sense of returning the favor, duty, and depending on the time and circumstance, can be in a relation where \u201cresponsibility\u201d is being shared. There is no sense of trouble following when X is doing it out of thanks for something Y has already done in return before. This explains most situations. Even if you have someone do something that you&nbsp;don&#8217;t&nbsp;have a close relationship with, there are numerous situations where the other person is deemed to have a duty to give you a favor. For instance, say you are an old woman in an airport. You will probably have someone carry your luggage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>45. \u8377\u7269\u3092\u904b\u3093\u3067\u3082\u3089\u3048\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304b\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could I have you carry my luggage?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>46. \u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u5f93\u696d\u54e1\u306b\u8377\u7269\u3092\u904b\u3093\u3067\u3082\u3089\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had an employee carry my luggage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>47. \u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068<ruby>\u624b\u4f1d<rt>\u3066\u3064\u3060<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u3051\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304b\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could you help me?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>48. \u5f7c\u3092<ruby>\u96fb\u8a71\u53e3<rt>\u3067\u3093\u308f\u3050\u3061<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306b\u304a\u547c\u3073\u3044\u305f\u3060\u3051\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304b\u3002&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would you mind calling him to the phone?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \uff5e\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3046 also adds to the speech modals that have the ability to show commands.

It is the speaker that is the requester, and it is that the listener that is the person being requested to do A. Things balance out, however.
