The reason why some say it&#8217;s rude is because it should be what a business should say to a customer. Meaning, it is they who may have not shown affability to you as they should have.

There are times when adding \u3054 results in Double Keigo (\u4e8c\u91cd\u656c\u8a9e). For instance, in \u3054\u82b3\u540d (your good name), \u3054\u4ee4\u606f (son), \u3054\u901d\u53bb (death), the nouns themselves are already honorific. But, because they have for whatever reason been reanalyzed as being not honorific enough, \u3054 is always attached to them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>Examples<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.&nbsp;<ruby>\u5927\u5909<rt>\u305f\u3044\u3078\u3093<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3054<ruby>\u9762\u5012<rt>\u3081\u3093\u3069\u3046<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3092\u304a\u304b\u3051\u3057\u3066\u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#8217;m very sorry to have put you into any trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><ruby>7. \u5148\u751f<\/ruby>\u306b<ruby>\u8336\u9053<rt>\u3055\u3069\u3046<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e\u3054<ruby>\u6559\u6388<rt>\u304d\u3087\u3046\u3058\u3085<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3092<ruby>\u8cdc<rt>\u305f\u307e\u308f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u308a\u305f\u3044\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Would you be so kind as to give me instruction on tea ceremonies?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. \u3054<ruby>\u8a02\u6b63<rt>\u3066\u3044\u305b\u3044<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3092\u9802\u6234\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3066\u3001\u3069\u3046\u3082\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you very much for giving me corrections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9. \u3069\u3046\u305e\u3054<ruby>\u9060\u616e<rt>\u3048\u3093\u308a\u3087<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306a\u304f\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Feel free.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>\u307f\uff5e<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u307f\uff5e&nbsp;is used with nouns particular to religion or grand importance.

For respectful nouns,\u00a0\u8cb4\uff5e is apart of many respectful Sino-Japanese words. However, most, with exception to \u8cb4\u793e &#8220;your honorable company&#8221; are rarely used.

For representing respectfulness in terms of family, the suffix \uff5e\u4e0a\uff08\u3046\u3048\uff09 is used.

Whenever a word refers to royalty, that said variant is not used in reference to regular people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u7c97\u54c1 may also mean &#8220;little gift&#8221;. This would still be \u66f8\u304d\u8a00\u8449\u7684.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. \u7c97&nbsp;means &#8220;crude\/course\/inferior&#8221; and these meanings are implied in the humble words whether the thing(s) in question are as such.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. Sometimes using the right word can be tricky. For instance, whenever people take entrance exams for college (\u5165\u5b66\u8a66\u9a13) and companies (\u5165\u8a66\u8a66\u9a13), people these days are starting to want to use \u5fa1\u6821 and \u5fa1\u793e respectively instead of \u8cb4\u6821 or \u8cb4\u793e. The problem with this is with \u5fa1 being read as \u304a\u3093, it may sound quite unnatural in the spoken language if it were not for abnormal situation in which one is in front of many people you don&#8217;t know. Although \u8cb4\u6821 and \u8cb4\u793e may get used in letters between groups in an almost equal mentality, the most important thing in \u656c\u8a9e is still to be conscious overall of ways to speak politely. Thus, it is quite OK to use those words. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>HONORIFIC VARIANTS FOR DEATH<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;\u5d29\u5fa1\u3000\uff08\u307b\u3046\u304e\u3087\uff09<\/td><td>&nbsp;The honorable death of royalty.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u5352\u53bb \uff08\u305d\u3063\u304d\u3087\uff09<\/td><td>&nbsp;Death of king or queen or a high ranking court official.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u901d\u53bb\u3000\uff08\u305b\u3044\u304d\u3087\uff09<\/td><td>&nbsp;A more honorific word for the passing of an individual.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u85a8\u53bb\u3000\uff08\u3053\u3046\u304d\u3087\uff09<\/td><td>&nbsp;Death of an imperial member or high court.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u85a8\u5fa1\u3000\uff08\u3053\u3046\u304e\u3087\uff09<\/td><td>&nbsp;The death of a crowned prince or minister.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Word Note<\/strong>: It is unlikely that you will see some of these words, but there is always that chance. &#8220;To die&#8221; is generally a euphemism for several other verbs such as \u6b7b\u4ea1\u3059\u308b (to decease), \u6b7b\u53bb\u3059\u308b (to part), and \u4ea1\u304f\u306a\u308b (to pass away)&#8221;.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>HONORIFIC PHRASES WITH HONORIFIC PREFIXES &amp; SUFFIXES<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also many set phrases that include the prefixes \u304a\uff5e and \u3054\uff5e and the honorific endings \uff5e\u3055\u3093 and \uff5e\u3055\u307e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;\u304a\u6708\uff5b\u3055\u307e\u30fb\u3055\u3093\uff5d\u3000<\/td><td>&nbsp;Moon<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u304a\u65e5\uff5b\u3055\u307e\u30fb\u3055\u3093\uff5d\u3000<\/td><td>&nbsp;Sun<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u304a\u4e16\u8a71\u3055\u307e\u3000<\/td><td>&nbsp;Trouble<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u304a\u90aa\u9b54\u3055\u307e<\/td><td>&nbsp;Trouble<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u304a\u75b2\u308c\u3055\u307e\u3000<\/td><td>&nbsp;Tired One<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u304a\u6c17\u306e\u6bd2\u3055\u307e\u3000<\/td><td>&nbsp;I&#8217;m very sorry<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u3054\u9762\u5012\u3055\u307e\u3000<\/td><td>&nbsp;Could I trouble you<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u3054\u82e6\u52b4\u3055\u307e\u3000<\/td><td>&nbsp;Much obliged for hardship<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>FORMAL SINO-JAPANESE WORDS<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some nouns are naturally formal because they are Sino-Japanese.
