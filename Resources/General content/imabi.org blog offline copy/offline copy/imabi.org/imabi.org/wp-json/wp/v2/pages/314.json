First, let&#8217;s define both &#8220;nominalization&#8221; and &#8220;nominalizer&#8221; for the purpose of this discussion:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Nominalization: <em>The grammatical process of rendering one part of speech, such as a verb or adjective, or even entire phrases and abstract nouns, into a single nominal phrase that functions as a noun, which may be done out of grammatical necessity or for some other purpose.<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nominalizer: <em>There are three primary morphemes which may be used to nominalize something: the particle <\/em>\u306e<em>, <\/em>\u3053\u3068<em>, and <\/em>\u3082\u306e<em>. These morphemes are collectively referred to as dummy nouns (<\/em>\u5f62\u5f0f\u540d\u8a5e<em>).<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Nominalizers \u306e and \u3053\u3068<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The nominalizers&nbsp;\u306e&nbsp;and \u3053\u3068 are&nbsp;both used to nominalize predicates to have them rendered as nouns syntactically, although the degree to which the resultant &#8220;noun&#8221; is noun-like is limited.&nbsp;At a basic understanding, the nominalizers \u306e and \u3053\u3068 semantically differ largely on perceived objectivity\/subjectivity of the resultant statement formed. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An objective perspective is one that is not influenced by personal emotions, static in its relationship to truth statements, whereas a subject perspective would (heavily) interject emotional appeal to whatever statement is being made. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Relating all this to these nominalizers, \u4e8b as a standalone noun<sup data-fn=\"018aa4f5-3c79-4b08-95f6-2095127ceaea\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#018aa4f5-3c79-4b08-95f6-2095127ceaea\" id=\"018aa4f5-3c79-4b08-95f6-2095127ceaea-link\">1<\/a><\/sup>, not to be confused with its dummy function used as a nominalizer, can be translated as &#8220;matter\/thing,&#8221; but it can also be translated as &#8220;circumstance.&#8221; It is this latter translation that serves as a bridging context with its nominalizer function, which is why it appears in so many constructions involving nominalizing verbal\/adjectival predicates for the purpose of denoting factual statements from an objective point of view.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u898b\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u4fe1\u305a\u308b<sup data-fn=\"e3a6912c-8210-4aa0-8131-242077316577\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#e3a6912c-8210-4aa0-8131-242077316577\" id=\"e3a6912c-8210-4aa0-8131-242077316577-link\">2<\/a><\/sup>\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002<br>Seeing is believing. &nbsp;<br><br>Judging whether a statement is objective or subjective is not an &#8220;all-or-nothing&#8221; dynamic. Rather, certain grammatical structures lean one way or another, creating the syntactical and desired emotional framework for what the speaker is aiming to get across. Here, the underlying structure is X\u306fY\u3067\u3042\u308b. Here, X and Y must both be nouns, and a sense of grammatical parallelism is enforced to make the resultant definition of X as Y. While believing whether &#8220;seeing is believing&#8221; can be a subjective debate to be had, within the confines of this sentence, \u3053\u3068 is used as opposed to \u306e because \u898b\u308b\u3053\u3068 and \u4fe1\u305a\u308b\u3053\u3068 are being treated as distinct entities=circumstances that can be defined. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, a more subjective-leaning construction will likely involve the nominalizer \u306e. Although it does derive from the particle \u306e, as a nominalizer, it functions as a dummy noun. just like \u3053\u3068. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u304a\u4e8c\u4eba\u304c\u4f1a\u3046\u306e\u306f\u521d\u3081\u3066\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>Is this the first time you two have met?<br><br>The speaker (one asking the question) does not the nature of the meeting of the two people in question. Truly, [\u521d\u3081\u3066\u3067\u3059\u304b] is an educated guess at best, which speaks to the subjectivity of the statement as a whole. Compare this with Ex. 3, which is objectively clear about the circumstance surrounding [\u4f1a\u3046\u3053\u3068].<br><br>3. \u79c1\u81ea\u8eab\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u306e\u7537\u6027\u3068\u4f1a\u3046\u3053\u3068\u306f\u521d\u3081\u3066\u3067\u4e0d\u5b89\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>It&#8217;s my first time meeting a guy on an dating app, and I&#8217;m anxious about it.<br><br>Subjectivity is not always about there being an emotional appeal in the sentence. Here, the speaker is speaking about their own experience in the making, and descriptions of one&#8217;s own emotions are a reflection of one&#8217;s reality. Conjecture regarding that reality would be subjective, but, as is a common theme when debating over whether to use \u3053\u3068 or \u306e, is irrelevant in the context of this sentence. In the next set of examples, however, the subjectivity behind the claim made in Ex. 5 starkly differs from the generic, objective statement of fact in Ex. 4.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u30ab\u30ca\u30c0\u304c\u5bd2\u3044\u3053\u3068\u306b\u6c17\u3065\u3044\u305f\u3002(Objective)<br>I just noticed that Canada is cold. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. \u30ab\u30ca\u30c0\u3063\u3066\u30da\u30f3\u30ae\u30f3\u3082\u751f\u304d\u308c\u308b\u307b\u3069\u5bd2\u3044\u306e\u306b\u6c17\u3065\u3044\u305f\u3093\u3060\uff01(Subjective)&nbsp;<br>I realized that Canada is cold enough for penguins to even live! <br><br>Next, for Exs. 6-10, \u3053\u3068 is the correct nominalizer.

The first is to focus on a certain action or state as the object of attention. The other is to expand the scope of something to encompass the situation surrounding it. In this latter sense, it abstracts. At face value, this seems like the opposite of focusing. However, this isn&#8217;t really the case.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When \u3053\u3068 attaches itself to verbs and adjectives, which in both cases could involve an entire sentence, \u3053\u3068 packs up these expressions into a noun phrase, making it refer to the action\/state at hand. This is the focusing aspect. When it follows a noun, however, it&#8217;s following something that is already concrete to some extent. By using \u3053\u3068, which literally means &#8220;matter\/circumstance,&#8221; you are no longer literally talking about the physical entity at hand. Rather, you&#8217;re talking about its essence, which is truly the matter at hand.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>30. \u3042\u306e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u306e\u3053\u3068\u3092\u3088\u304f\u899a\u3048\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>I remember that incident well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sentence Note<\/strong>: In this example, the speaker remembers a lot about the incident.
