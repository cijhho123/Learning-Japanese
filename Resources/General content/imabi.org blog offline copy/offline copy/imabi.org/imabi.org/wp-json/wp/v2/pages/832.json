The four-character idiom&nbsp;\u51a0\u5a5a\u846c\u796d encapsulates these ceremonies in one word. By breaking down this word, we see that&nbsp;\u5a5a stands for &#8220;marriage ceremony&#8221; (\u5a5a\u793c) and&nbsp;\u846c stands for &#8220;funeral ceremony&#8221; (\u846c\u5100). Then, \u51a0&nbsp;is in reference to special milestones such as the coming-of-age ceremony and \u796d refers to Shinto ceremonies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By looking into these ceremonies, you will gain a better appreciation of Japanese culture and begin to understand what it means to live life in a &#8216;Japanese&#8217; fashion. Birth, marriage, death, and the celebrations that fill one&#8217;s life all carry a Japanese perspective worth investigating.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u51a0: Turning Point Celebrations\u3000\u4eba\u751f\u306e\u7bc0\u76ee\u306e\u304a\u795d\u3044<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Congratulations on Giving Birth \u51fa\u7523\u795d\u3044<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The health of a new mother and her child(ren) is utmost, and expressing joy to the family is especially important. If you are not immediate family, however, it is best not to rush over to directly convey one&#8217;s thoughts unless there is a deeper connection that warrants such behavior. Otherwise, it is standard etiquette to let them know via letter or electronic correspondence (\u96fb\u5831). It is standard to go visit the new mother and her child(ren) about a month after having given birth. Make sure to visit once you&#8217;ve confirmed with them that both the mother and child(ren) are doing well. If you yourself are not feeling well, refrain from visiting until you are fully healthy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you choose to send a letter, an e-mail, or a text message, make sure your language is appropriate. Avoid any sort of taboo word (\u5fcc\u307f\u8a00\u8449) that may relate to death (\u6b7b), separation (\u5225\u308c), etc. This tradition has remained true even with the COVID 19 pandemic (\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u798d). Although some may take a comment such as &#8220;surviving COVID and starting a beautiful family&#8221; as an uplifting compliment, others may be frightened of something so ominous being mentioned in relation to their child&#8217;s birth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you are being respectful, even if you are a friend, but also don&#8217;t write your message too formally either. This may come off as being rude under a veneer of politeness (\u6147\u61c3\u7121\u793c). Make sure you have no typos (\u8aa4\u5b57\u8131\u5b57) and that what you&#8217;ve written will make the receiver happy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.

In today&#8217;s society, 10,000 yen or more is viewed as being appropriate. If you are a close friend (\u53cb\u4eba), acquaintance (\u77e5\u4eba), colleague (\u540c\u50da), work associate (\u8077\u5834\u95a2\u4fc2\u8005), etc.,&nbsp;3-5,000 yen is appropriate. In addition to cash, gift certificates (\u30ae\u30d5\u30c8\u5238), toys (\u73a9\u5177), diapers (\u304a\u3080\u3064), baby clothes (\u30d9\u30d3\u30fc\u670d), etc. are also appropriate. However, if you do send clothing, be sure to keep in mind the season and what size the child(ren) need(s). To be on the safe side, try sending clothing that the child may use at age 1-2 as it may be hard to gauge how quickly the child might grow, potentially not even able to wear something you buy if it becomes out-of-season and the child is no longer the size you had bought. The gifts, though, need not be limited to direct use for the child. Parents will also appreciate books on childrearing (\u80b2\u5150\u66f8), backpacks (\u30ea\u30e5\u30c3\u30af) for carrying&nbsp;diapers, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Coming of Age Ceremony \u6210\u4eba\u5f0f<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u6210\u4eba\u306e\u65e5 is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.imabi.net\/holidays\">national holiday<\/a>, a day which celebrates those who have turned 20, which is the age of adulthood in Modern Japan. This tradition, as mentioned earlier, is based on the older tradition known as \u5143\u670d\u306e\u5100, which was also alternatively known as \u52a0\u51a0\u306e\u5100.&nbsp;Males aged 11-16 would change their clothing to adult status, and for those who were of court noble status or higher, that attire would include adorning one&#8217;s head with a cap known as a \u51a0.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the major difference between the prior ceremony and the modern iteration is that the former one was male-centric, limited to certain castes of society, and affected boys of varying age in their teens depending on when it was deemed suitable for that child to start behaving as a man, whereas the modern ceremony is held equally for both sexes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though not all municipalities may be the same, most local governments of Japan annual hold coming-of-age ceremonies. Men have the choice of either wearing suits or traditional hakama (\u88b4), and women may wear either a formal dress or a long-sleeved kimono (\u632f\u8896).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, aside from the ceremony itself, congratulating those being commemorated by the ceremony is just as important.

On the front side of the card, the newlyweds will write either \u5185\u795d or \u5bff, with the latter Kanji frequently stylized.

Shinto ceremonies used to mainstream up until around 30 years ago when popularity in Christian ceremonies surpassed the tradition. In Modern Japan, about 20% still choose this route, though, as it best reflects Japanese tradition (\u4f1d\u7d71) and also provides the opportunity of choosing the shrine for your new&nbsp;family.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ceremony is held (\u6319\u5f0f) at the main sanctuary&nbsp;(\u672c\u6bbf) Shinto shrine (\u795e\u6bbf).&nbsp;Leading up to the rituals (\u795e\u4e8b), it&#8217;s important to cleanse oneself. The ritual for washing one&#8217;s hands is known as \u624b\u6c34\uff08\u3061\u3087\u3046\u305a\uff09\u306e\u5100.

This procession is known as \u53c2\u9032\uff08\u3055\u3093\u3057\u3093\uff09. At the hall of worship (\u62dd\u6bbf),&nbsp;the couple takes a seat near the gods with the groom on the left and the bride on the right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The priest performs a purification ritual for the couple and attendees known as \u4fee\u7953\uff08\u3057\u3085\u306f\u3064\uff09. With the start of the ceremony now truly commencing, everyone rises with the priest responsible for the religious ceremonies (\u658e\u4e3b) at the forefront, at which point all bow their heads in worship (\u62dd\u793c). Food offerings are then presented to the gods. This is known as&nbsp; \u732e\u994c\uff08\u3051\u3093\u305b\u3093\uff09.

The gods Izanagi and Izanami are also often invoked in prayers made during the ceremony.

The smaller of the cups represents the past, the medium-sized cup represents the present and the larger cup represents the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the couple approaches the alter, the groom reads out his vows while the bride listens. A &#8216;matchmaker&#8217; (\u4ef2\u4eba) will be thanked in the vows. If there wasn&#8217;t a matchmaker, then the role is filled in a similar way to that of a best man or bridesmaid. Reading out one&#8217;s vows is called \u8a93\u8a5e\u594f\u4e0a\uff08\u305b\u3044\u3057\u305d\u3046\u3058\u3087\u3046\uff09.&nbsp;Then, priest maidens offer a dance to the gods to further appease them and bless the occasion.

A marriage is only legally recognized once a couple has successfully submitted the required documents (\u5a5a\u59fb\u5c4a)&nbsp;to the city hall registrar (\u5e02\u5f79\u6240) to change their status in their family registration sheet (\u6238\u7c4d).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this article of the Constitution has been interpreted by scholars and most recently in a 2021 court decision as only foreseeing the existence of heterosexual marriage (\u7570\u6027\u5a5a). Therefore, it is not an outright ban on same-sex marriage (\u540c\u6210\u5a5a). Nonetheless, revision to existing Japanese law would be necessary to allow for marriage equality.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It must be noted that same-sex couples may still wish to perform wedding ceremonies.

When and how to show one&#8217;s condolences (\u304a\u6094\u307f) to the family&nbsp;can also be a complicated and sensitive. The vigil (\u901a\u591c), funeral (\u846c\u5100), and memorial service (\u544a\u5225\u5f0f) are all aspects of showing one&#8217;s respects to the deceased (\u5f14\u554f).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full term for burial rites is \u846c\u9001\uff08\u5100\u793c\uff09.

With that being said, let&#8217;s try to go through as much of the basic terms and customs that you ought to be aware of.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participating in a funeral is expressed with \u846c\u5100\u306b\u53c2\u5217\u3059\u308b. Depending on the kind of funeral and the wishes of the family (\u907a\u65cf), there may be restrictions held on who else may be present for the actual funeral rites.

It also doesn&#8217;t help that there isn&#8217;t unilateral decision on what to do.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The amount of money you give is based on your relation to the person.

Our deceased loved one is certainly happy (that you&#8217;ve come). While they were alive, they received especial hospitality (from all of you), and they were very thankful for that. For those who have the time, we&#8217;ve set up food in the other room, so please feel free to relax.&nbsp;<br>Also, as for tomorrow&#8217;s funeral, the plan is to perform it at xx at ## o&#8217;clock. Thank you in advance.<br>And of course, thank you so much for today.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tradition dates back to the ancient practice of \u6baf\uff08\u3082\u304c\u308a\uff09. The body of the deceased would be place in a coffin and temporarily installed (\u5b89\u7f6e) in a building known as a \u6baf\u5bae\uff08\u3082\u304c\u308a\u306e\u307f\u3084\uff09 for people to go to give their respects during the long time until the actual funeral. Such buildings today would be referred to as &#8220;mortuaries&#8221; or \u5b89\u7f6e\u6240\uff08\u3042\u3093\u3061\u3058\u3087\uff09, which do exist for preparing the body for burial\/cremation. Rather than being the night before, the body traditionally was set out until the remains skeletonized (\u767d\u9aa8\u5316\u3057\u305f\u907a\u4f53) to ensure that the person had truly died.&nbsp;The&nbsp;term \u6baf is still used as one of the practices done in the burial rites of the Imperial Family \u5927\u55aa\u5100\uff08\u305f\u3044\u305d\u3046\u304e\uff09.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point of the coffin leaving the home\/vigil site\/funeral home is known as \u51fa\u68fa\uff08\u3057\u3085\u3063\u304b\u3093\uff09. For the most part, bodies are sent to be cremated \u706b\u846c\uff08\u304b\u305d\u3046\uff09 at a crematory \u706b\u846c\u5834\uff08\u304b\u305d\u3046\u3070\uff09. When going home, the family does not take the same road they took to get to the crematory. Though some Buddhist sects frown on the tradition, a Shinto relic done at this time is the spreading of purifying salt known as \u632f\u308a\u5869\uff08\u3058\u304a\uff09is done after the funeral.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the ashes are being gathered (\u53ce\u9aa8\u30fb\u9aa8\u4e0a\u3052\u30fb\u304a\u9aa8\u62fe\u3044),&nbsp;one person uses chopsticks to pass each bone to the second person in what is known as \u7bb8\u6e21\u3057. This is a play on words in which \u7bb8 also stands for \u6a4b, and this two-person job is reminiscent of the deceased being taken from this world to the next. The bones are placed in a \u9aa8\u58fa\uff08\u3053\u3064\u3064\u307c\uff09 and the chopsticks used are especially made for this practice. When families wish to share bones between people (\u5206\u9aa8), a legal verification of each separate compilation of remains has to be processed and presented to the facility before the ceremony.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the event that the body is still lying in rest (before cremation), a knife\/sword-like weapon known as a \u5b88\u308a\u5200 may be placed on the chest of the deceased to ward off evil spirits as a talisman (\u9b54\u9664\u3051). In a Buddhist setting, offerings (\u4f9b\u3048\u7269\u30fb\u4f9b\u7269) such as \u6795\u98ef (rice placed at the bedside of the deceased) or \u6795\u56e3\u5b50 (rice cakes placed at the bedside of the deceased) may also be present. Buddhist households may choose to leave anywhere from 6, 13, or 49 of these &#8216;meals&#8217; depending on the source of inspiration. 6 relates to the 6 realms (\u516d\u9053), 13 relates to the 13 buddhas (\u5341\u4e09\u4ecf), and 49 is the 49th day after the death of the individual known as \u56db\u5341\u4e5d\u65e5\uff08\u3057\u3058\u3085\u3046\u304f\u306b\u3061\uff09.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the funeral, prayers and messages will likely be given by some religious official. In a Buddhist context, a monk (\u50e7\u4fb6) may read a sutra (\u8aad\u7d4c) and offer incense (\u713c\u9999). In a Shinto context, they may give a prayer (\u796d\u8a5e). In a Christian setting, a reading from the Bible (\u8056\u66f8\u306e\u6717\u8aad) along with a prayer (\u304a\u7948\u308a) can be expected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The farewell ceremony is known as \u544a\u5225\u5f0f\uff08\u3053\u304f\u3079\u3064\u3057\u304d\uff09. Sending the body\/ashes to the final resting place is known as \u91ce\u8fba\u9001\u308a.Various regions may have other customs associated with the funeral procession\uff08\u846c\u5217\uff09. This is the last moment for those who have attended the funeral (\u4f1a\u846c\u8005) to give their respects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, known of these practices are held and the body is immediately cremated and buried\/ashes stored. This is known as \u76f4\u846c\uff08\u3061\u3087\u304f\u305d\u3046\uff09. This happens frequently when the deceased no longer has any friends or family, but it may also be done to prevent the spread of decease. This practice has become especially more common since the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. When the identity of a body cannot be determined, assisted funerals (\u52a9\u846c) may be held by NPOs or other welfare organizations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shinto Funerals<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Purely Shinto-style funerals are rare as the traditions mentioned above linked to Buddhism are so widespread. Nonetheless, such funerals are known as \u795e\u846c\u796d\uff08\u3057\u3093\u305d\u3046\u3055\u3044\uff09. As death is viewed as impure in Shintoism, such funerals are not actually held at Shinto shrines. Instead, they are either held at the home of the deceased or at a&nbsp;\u846c\u658e\u5834\uff08\u305d\u3046\u3055\u3044\u3058\u3087\u3046\uff09, which is essentially the Shinto wording for crematory. During the ceremony, an alter (\u796d\u58c7) will be placed with a picture of the deceased (\u907a\u5f71), and to the back of the coffin (\u68fa), a flag with the name of the deceased (\u9298\u65d7) is placed. The surroundings may also be adorned with lit fire (\u706f\u660e), sakaki branches, and offerings. The priest will performing a cleansing ceremony for those attending, present the offerings (\u795e\u994c) to the deceased &#8216;kami&#8217;, read out the prayer \uff08\u796d\u8a5e\u306e\u594f\u4e0a\uff09, and asked the deceased who is now an ancestor spirit to protect the family that remains living, and while holding sakaki branches (\u7389\u4e32), those attending bow twice, clap once, and bow once more \uff08\u4e8c\u62dd\u4e8c\u62cd\u4e00\u62dd\uff09. The clapping is known as (\u5072\u3073\u624b) as it is not meant to make a sound so as not to disturb the spirit of the deceased.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Christian Funerals<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Japan, Christian funerals don&#8217;t behave much differently than Buddhist ones. The difference is that Buddhist rituals are replaced by Christian ones. However, the timing of the vigil, funeral service, and farewell service are typically the same.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever \u901a\u591c is felt to have too strong of Buddhist imagery, \u524d\u591c\u796d may be used instead. Yet, it is still the case that people may offer incense and flowers for the deceased. For the funeral, Catholics will hold a funeral mass (\u846c\u5100\u30df\u30b5). Generally speaking, the number of Christians in Japan is small, so it is more likely for the funeral to be fitted in a way that is most familiar to those attending rather than being strict to Christian dogma.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of religion, people shun away from extravagant attire, and across the board, black clothing is preferred as this is the traditional color to signify mourning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Buddhist Memorial Services \u3000\u6cd5\u8981<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Buddhist memorial services don&#8217;t just occur the day of the funeral in a Japanese household. Even if the person who has deceased had a Shinto-style or a Christian-style funeral, their life may still be honored following the timing of the many Buddhist-style memorial commemorations that are held well past death. One of which we&#8217;ve already touched on was commemorating the 49th day after passing known as \u56db\u5341\u4e5d\u65e5, but now we&#8217;ll be looking at a closer look at these services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Buddhism, the 49 day period after a person has passed away is known as \u4e2d\u9670\uff08\u3061\u3085\u3046\u3044\u3093\uff09 and the 49th day of that period is known as \u6e80\u4e2d\u9670. During that length of time, it is believed that the sole of the deceased (\u6b7b\u8005\u306e\u9b42) has not entered Nirvana, a process known as \u6210\u4ecf\uff08\u3058\u3087\u3046\u3076\u3064\uff09, and because of this memorial services (\u8ffd\u5584\u4f9b\u990a) to pray for their happiness in the next world (\u51a5\u798f\u30fb\u3081\u3044\u3075\u304f).

Even with limited Japanese, Shinto priests would be more than happy to sit down with you and discuss any matter about the faith that you may have.
