Yet, the case particle \u3064 has only ever been used to indicate attributes (\u5c5e\u683c). <br><br>Although the sample size of instances of \u3064 in Classical Japanese pales in comparison to how many examples can be found of \u304c\u30fb\u306e, significant overlap can be found, suggesting that at the very least, significant dialectal variation must have existed as to which which was preferred. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Words Commonly Paired with \uff5e\u3064<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>While most instances of \u3064 are archaisms, instances from the \u4e07\u8449\u96c6 still

If written in kanji, \u304b\u3089 would be best spelled as \u67c4. This suffix lives on in words like \u81ea\u3089 (myself) and \u81ea\u305a\u304b\u3089 (of one&#8217;s own accord), but it can also be seen in \u53e3\u3065\u304b\u3089 (in one&#8217;s own words). <br><br>4. \u5fa1\u9580\u306e\u3001\u5fa1\u304f\u3061\u3065\u304b\u3089\u3054\u3066\u7d66\u3078\u308b\u306a\u308a\u3002<br>The emperor had said this himself. <br>From the \u300e\u6e90\u6c0f\u7269\u8a9e\u300f.<br><br>In Classical Japanese, this suffix could also still indicate &#8220;relationship&#8221; when attached to a noun related to human relationships\u2014e.g. \u5f93\u59b9\u3065\u304b\u3089 (cousin relationship). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Conjunctive Particle \u3064<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The conjunctive particle \u3064 has been used throughout Japanese to indicate two repetitive actions which go back and forth.
