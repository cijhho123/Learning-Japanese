Its te-form is also used as an adverb. Together, all three functions mentioned will be discussed thoroughly in this lesson.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">As a Standalone Verb\u3000\u5358\u72ec\u3067\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u308b\u52d5\u8a5e\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u7528\u6cd5<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The verb \u6025\u3050 has two closely related functions. It either expresses one&#8217;s aims of getting something done in a haste or one&#8217;s attempt at getting to some destination quickly. In the first sense, it can be viewed as any typical transitive verb.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>i. \u5efa\u7bc9\u3092\u6025\u3050<br>To hasten construction<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ii. \u63a5\u7a2e\u3092\u6025\u3050<br>To hasten vaccination<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second sense of rushing to reach a destination, it is frequently used with the particle \u3092, but the verb actually functions as an intransitive verb. Thus, whatever noun of place\/time you see it used with is the transition space that one is hurrying through.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>iii. \u9053\u3092\u6025\u3050<br>To hurry on one&#8217;s way<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>iv. \u591c\u3092\u6025\u3050<br>To rush through the night<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second usage is far more common and it&#8217;s even more common to use it by itself to state that one is in a hurry. To aid in distinguishing between intransitive and transitive sentences, the following examples will be labeled so that you can look back at the definition of either sense if you get lost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u5317\u671d\u9bae\u306f\u3001\u5236\u88c1\u3084\u5727\u529b\u3068\u306f\u95a2\u4fc2\u306a\u304f\u3001\u6838\u30df\u30b5\u30a4\u30eb\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5b8c\u6210<strong>\u3092\u6025\u3044\u3067\u3044\u308b<\/strong>\u3002(Transitive)<br>North Korea is rushing to complete its nuclear missile technology irrespective of sanctions and pressure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u5e30\u5b85<strong>\u3092\u6025\u3044\u3067\u3044\u305f\u308a<\/strong>\u75b2\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u308a\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u904b\u8ee2\u3092\u3059\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002(Transitive)<br>Even when I may be trying to rush or home or even when I&#8217;m tired, I always practice safe driving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Word Note<\/strong>: \u5e30\u5b85 is a Sino-Japanese word meaning &#8220;returning home.&#8221; Paraphrasing this into native vocabulary would be \u5bb6\u306b\u5e30\u308b\u3053\u3068. Saying \u5bb6\u306b\u5e30\u308b\u306e\u3092\u6025\u3050 is possible but wordy and sounds like a definition rather than a naturally uttered sentence. As for \u5e30\u5b85\u3092\u6025\u3050, it is grammatical because it is stating an attempt at rushing the act of getting home. Where some speakers get tripped up is the existence of \u5bb6\u8def\u3092\u6025\u3050, which uses the noun&nbsp;\u5bb6\u8def meaning &#8220;the route home.&#8221; Thus, you&#8217;re saying &#8220;rushing down the route home.&#8221; If one tries equating \u5e30\u5b85 and \u5bb6\u8def as one and the same thing, then \u5e30\u5b85\u3092\u6025\u3050 would sound unnatural because \u5e30\u5b85 is not a transition space.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3001\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068<strong>\u6025\u3044\u3067\u3044\u307e\u3059<\/strong>\u306e\u3067\u3002(Intransitive)<br>I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m in a bit of a worry, so&#8230; (I can&#8217;t talk).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u3054\u3081\u3093\u3001\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068<strong>\u6025\u3044\u3067\u308b<\/strong>\u3093\u3067\u3002 (Informal) (Intransitive)<br>Sorry, I&#8217;m a little busy, so&#8230; (I can&#8217;t talk).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. \u4f55<strong>\u3092\u6025\u3050<\/strong>\u3093\u3060\uff1f(Transitive)<br>What are you in such a rush for?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.&nbsp;<strong>\u6025\u3050\u306a<\/strong>\uff01(Intransitive)<br>Don&#8217;t rush!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7.&nbsp;<strong>\u6025\u3050<\/strong>\u5fc5\u8981\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3088\u3002(Intransitive)<br>There&#8217;s no need to hurry\/rush.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. \u5148<strong>\u3092\u6025\u3050<\/strong>\u884c\u52d5\u3068\u3044\u3046\u306e\u306f\u3001\u751f\u5b58\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u4eba\u9593\u306b\u67d3\u307f\u4ed8\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u672c\u80fd\u306e\u3072\u3068\u3064\u3060\u3002(Intransitive)<br>The act of hurrying ahead is one instinct ingrain in humans for survival.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9.&nbsp;<strong>\u6025\u304c\u3070<\/strong>\u56de\u308c\u3002(Intransitive) (Proverb)<br>More haste, less speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phrase Note<\/strong>: Ex. is the Japanese equivalent of &#8220;slow and steady wins the race.&#8221; It would literally translate as, &#8220;spin around (in circles) if you&#8217;re going to be hasty.&#8221; As for \u6025\u304c\u3070, this is an old-fashioned hypothetical construction which equates to &#8220;if you rush.&#8221; In today&#8217;s speech, it would be \u6025\u3052\u3070, but in this set phrase, the old form is used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10. \u5584\u306f\u6025\u3052\u3002(Transitive) (Proverb)<br>Strike while the iron is hot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phrase Note<\/strong>: This proverb emphasizes how you should rush a good opportunity before the situation changes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11. \u5f31\u99ac\u9053\u3092\u6025\u3050\u3002(Intransitive) (Proverb)<br>Those who lack talent rush to success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phrase Note<\/strong>: Those who lack the skills and talents necessary for smooth success tend to rush the process, and this is akin to how a weak horse will still try to rush to its destination, perhaps unaware of how insignificant it is to other horses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Adverb \u6025\u3044\u3067<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even more common than using \u6025\u3050 as a standalone verb, using its te-form as an adverb.
