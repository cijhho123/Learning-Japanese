Even Japanese grammarians have published countless papers on the topic to solve the age-old question. At a basic understanding, the two particles do, in fact, serve different purposes. Putting nuances aside&#8230; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The particle \u304c is a case particle with the specific grammatical role of marking the subject of a sentence.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The particle \u306f is not a case particle, but rather a particle used to indicate the topic at hand, attaching to various types of words, not just nouns.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Source of the Confusion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Confusion arises when both \u306f and \u304c can theoretically work in a sentence after the grammatical subject. In such cases, context and logic enable native speakers to choose the appropriate particle with ease. For non-native speakers, however, managing the nuanced distinctions between the two requires careful practice and exposure. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that being said, our goal in this lesson will be to cover the absolute basics about \u306f so you can start using it confidently upon understanding its general functions. This will help you become better prepared to differentiate it from \u304c.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Curriculum Note<\/strong>: You are not required to study new grammar points used in the example sentences other than the particle \u306f at this time. &nbsp;Since the function and nuance of \u306f are shaped by the context or lack thereof that follows, observing it in action is crucial to fully understanding how it works. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Usage 1: The Topic Marker \u306f\u3000<br>\u4e3b\u984c\u3092\u8868\u3059\u300c\u306f\u300d<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first and most important usage of \u306f that we will discuss is how it functions as a topic marker. First, we will discuss what is meant by the word &#8220;topic.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a &#8220;Topic&#8221;?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The topic (\u4e3b\u984c) of a sentence can be an animate or inanimate entity (of one or more components), and that entity is what provides a starting point for conversation. A topic must also be something based on previously established information, whether it be from the ongoing conversation, one not too far back in the past, or from common sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The topic is considered to be &#8220;old information.&#8221; For something to be registered information, though, you may need to use&nbsp;\u304c&nbsp;first to establish it as so. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This distinction is clearly illustrated in the opening of the famous fairy tale \u6843\u592a\u90ce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;\u6614\u3005\u3001\u3042\u308b\u3068\u3053\u308d\u306b\u3001\u304a\u3058\u3044\u3055\u3093\u3068\u304a\u3070\u3042\u3055\u3093\u304c\u4f4f\u3093\u3067\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u304a\u3058\u3044\u3055\u3093\u306f\u5c71\u3078\u67f4\u5208\u308a\u306b\u3001\u304a\u3070\u3042\u3055\u3093\u306f\u5ddd\u3078\u6d17\u6fef\u306b\u884c\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>Long, long ago, there lived an old man and woman. One day, the old man went to the mountains to gather firewood, and the old woman went to the river to wash clothes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of a story, the reader presumably knows nothing about it. This is why the particle&nbsp;\u304c&nbsp;is used to mark the subjects and to establish them as the characters, which in turn is &#8220;new information&#8221; to the reader. Once the characters are established, they are then treated as the topic in the following sentence, which is why they are marked by&nbsp;\u306f. Note that although the comment that follows may still be new information, the topic itself is no longer new.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Examples and Explanations<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u3042\u308c\u306f\u79c1\u306e\u5e3d\u5b50\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>That&#8217;s my hat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sentence Note<\/strong>: Though the comment, the hat being the speaker&#8217;s, is &#8220;new information,&#8221; the recognition of the hat is not.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Japanese, phrases may be topicalized and put at or near the front of the sentence, after which point a comment is made about said topic. The comment could be already known or new information, but the topic is something implied to be known to both speaker and listener(s). Oftentimes, this is based on a common sense assessment of reality.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u304a\u540d\u524d\u306f\u4f55\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>What&#8217;s your name?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sentence Note<\/strong>: Everyone has a name. Even if this statement were not completely true, it is practically true. This is all the information one needs to know about the human world to understand how &#8220;your name&#8221; can be grammatically treated as &#8220;old\/registered&#8221; knowledge. You know the person you are talking to has a name; you just do not know what that person&#8217;s name is, which is why the question forms the comment about the topic. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u306f\u3069\u3053\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>Where is the toilet?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sentence Note<\/strong>: When you ask this question, you are assuming that there is a toilet nearby. The existence of toilets can be rather easily ascertained based on one&#8217;s surroundings. Asking this means you have already determined that there is one, and you are also implying that the existence and knowledge of its location is something that others might help you find out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. \u706b\u661f\u306f\u8d64\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>Mars is red.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sentence Note<\/strong>: Most people know about Mars, and so the acknowledgment of its existence is well established.

No additional context is required to determine that X and Y refer to the same entity. These factors enable a speaker to know that X is both the topic and the subject.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Ex. 14, X and Y are not the same entity, and while the various interpretations i-iv are not inherently so different as far as the ultimate interpretation of the sentence is concerned, the exact grammatical relationship between X and Y differs accordingly. Ex. 14 is an extreme (though famous) example of how much syntax-related information can be omitted in Japanese sentences, but in natural discourse, surrounding context allows speakers to effectively combat grammatical ambiguity. Nonetheless, let&#8217;s consider what these interpretations can tell us about X vs. Y.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>In \u30a6\u30ca\u30ae\u6587, \u3060 usually replaces a more complex predicate. <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If Y is attributed the role of the &#8220;object&#8221; which an agent (doer) X is acting upon, this results in i and iii. <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If Y is viewed as an &#8220;object&#8221; of desire, X is the subject which possesses that desire. This results in iv-v, with v requiring more context to reach an acceptable level of &#8220;naturalness&#8221; in both English and Japanese. <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>For ii, the topic \u50d5\u306f, much like other kinds of topicalized items, is an extra piece to the sentence, making X, the subject, \u30a6\u30ca\u30ae. Ironically, ii is still fairly synonymous with i. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3083\u304f\u6587<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When a learner fails to understand that the &#8220;topic&#8221; need not always be the subject, and what the consequence might be for not making the connection, misunderstandings like 14vi are inevitable. Likewise, when a learner fails to understand that the &#8220;topic&#8221; might coincide with the &#8220;agent&#8221; (cause\/initiator) but not the subject, sentences known as \u3053\u3093\u306b\u3083\u304f\u6587 become just as confusing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>15. \u3053\u3093\u306b\u3083\u304f\u306f\u592a\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002<br>You won&#8217;t put on weight from konjac. (\u2260 Konjac won&#8217;t put on weight).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These sentences come about by the &#8220;head&#8221; of an attributive predicate being omitted. In the case of Ex. 15, this omitted &#8220;head&#8221; of what would be a predicate in an attributive dependent clause can be simply understood to be &#8220;eat.&#8221; This allows for the sentence to be translated into English as, &#8220;As for konjac, you won&#8217;t gain weight from eating it.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>16. \u8da3\u5473\u306f\u30d0\u30b9\u30b1\u304c\u5144\u3067\u3001\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce\u304c\u59c9\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>As for hobbies, my older brother does basketball and my older sister does piano.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Ex. 16, the speaker has chosen not to actually use the word for &#8220;to do,&#8221; and is instead attributing his\/her siblings to those activities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Generic Statements<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many conversations are started off by mentioning something everyone already knows.

This usage of&nbsp;\u306f is very different from the exhaustive-listing statements that&nbsp;\u304c can make. Whereas an exhaustive-listing sentence is limited semantically solely to what is explicitly stated,&nbsp;\u306f is far more open-ended due to its generic nature.

There is a line of thought that the contrast marker meaning of&nbsp;\u306f&nbsp;is actually the primary meaning of&nbsp;\u306f. Within a given sentence, several&nbsp;\u306f&nbsp;may appear. Each one will have a different level of contrast implied.

With this being this case, it is viewed as the topic. Both the words for &#8220;yesterday&#8221; and &#8220;lunch&#8221; are marked with&nbsp;\u306f because they contrast with other scenarios.

Even without knowing the extra grammar points or words, the role that these particles play follow what is to be expected from their descriptions. Ex. 57&nbsp;is talking about noses, and the contrast that follows is still about noses. Ex. 58&nbsp;is simply about describing elephants, and so the length of their noses and tails are not being contrasted. In Ex. 59, though, these facts are being contrasted, and the topic is still on elephants, which is why there are three instances of \u306f in the same sentence. Then, there is X\u304cY\u304cZ in Ex. 60. It is possible to have two subjects like this in a Japanese sentence, but in this structure it is best to view [Y\u304cZ] as a single predicate unit which is being paired with the exhaustive meaning of \u304c.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>61.&nbsp;\u3042\u308c\u306f\u30aa\u30aa\u30ab\u30df\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3001\u72d0\u3060\u3088\u3002<br>That isn&#8217;t&nbsp;<em>a wolf<\/em>; it&#8217;s a fox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: This example demonstrates how the&nbsp;\u306f in \u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044 is also the contrasting&nbsp;\u306f.
