Both roughly indicate that X (person) wants (Y) to do the V (verb) in question (onto Z (direct object)). <br><br>6a. \u4e21\u89aa\u306b\u8912\u3081\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3044\u3002<br>6b. \u4e21\u89aa\u306b\u8912\u3081\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3044\u305f\u3044\u3002<br>6a. I want to be complimented by my parents.<br>6b. I want for my parents to compliment me. <br><br>The purpose of \uff5e\u305f\u3044 in either sentence is to show the desire of the wisher (usually the speaker) for the action of the predicate to realize. If the wisher wants their parents to compliment them, both a and b sound natural. <br><br>The short answer as to how these endings differ is that \uff5e\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3044 is used irrespective of the good intent Y (the agent) may provide the wisher (X) out of a simple desire for Y to carry out said V (action) that extends to them (X), being most natural with situations in which X (the wisher), has the least amount of control. <br>Meanwhile, with \uff5e\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3044\u305f\u3044, X (the wisher) is actively involved in <em>pressuring<\/em> Y to do said V (action), implying also that V is only natural to happen. <br><br>7. \u59bb\u304b\u3089\u9813\u6b7b\u3057\u305f\u3068\u601d\u308f\u308c\u305f\u3044\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3002(No Involvement by the Wisher)<br>I want my wife to think that I suddenly died.<br><br>8. \u98fc\u3044\u4e3b\u3055\u3093\u306f\u3001\u300c\u3053\u306e\u5bb6\u306b\u6765\u3066\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f\u300d\u3068\u308f\u3093\u3053\u306b\u601d\u3063\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3044\u305f\u3044\u3093\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\uff1f(Major Involvement by the Wisher)<br>Don&#8217;t (you as the) pet owner want (your) dog to think they&#8217;re so glad they came to your home? <br><br>Because the agent of \uff5e\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3044 (Y) ultimately performs the desired action of X regardless of X&#8217;s intent, this greatly limits the verbs that can be used with it. As for the verbs that can be frequently seen, verbs involving assessment such as \u898b\u308b (to view (as))\u30fb\u8a8d\u3081\u308b (to recognize (as)), verbs of emotion such as \u611b\u3059\u308b (to love)\u30fb\u5acc\u3046 (to detest), verbs of physical force (often with violence\/sexual) nuances in which Y exerts unilateral force onto X such as \u53f1\u308b (to scold)\u30fb\u632f\u308a\u56de\u3059 (to manipulate)\u30fb\u6bb4\u308b (to strike\/hit\/punch), etc.<br><br>9. \u611b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3044\u3001\u3067\u3082\u611b\u305d\u3046\u3068\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>I want to be loved, but I make no attempt to love.<br><br>10. \u4ed6\u4eba\u306b\u3088\u304f\u898b\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3044\u3002<br>I want to be watched by others. <br><br>11. \u3042\u305f\u3057\u3082\u3082\u3063\u3068\u898b\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3044\u306e\u3002<br>I want (you) to look at me more, too.<br><br>12. \u6bb4\u3089\u308c\u305f\u304f\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u5148\u306b\u6bb4\u3089\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u3044\u3044\u3002<br>If you don&#8217;t want to get punched, then just don&#8217;t punch first. <br><br>Conversely, there is no such semantic restrictions on \uff5e\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3044\u305f\u3044. Although it is not as likely to be used, comparatively speaking, with verbs with bad imagery, grammatically there would be nothing wrong with using said verbs so long as the force Y is exerting is (partially) due to X pressuring Y to do said action. This is where the &#8220;favor&#8221; aspect of \u3082\u3089\u3046 lies. <br><br>13a. \u53cb\u9054\u306b\u82f1\u8a9e\u3092\u6559\u3048\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3044\u305f\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3007<br>13b. \u53cb\u9054\u306b\u82f1\u8a9e\u3092\u6559\u3048\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002X<br><br>As Ex. 13 demonstrates, \uff5e\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3044 and \uff5e\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3044\u305f\u3044 are not fully interchangeable, and even in sentences in which they can replace the other, it may not always be the case that they roughly mean the same thing either.
