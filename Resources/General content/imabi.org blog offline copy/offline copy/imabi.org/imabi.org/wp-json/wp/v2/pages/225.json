It also does other things, though. Listing, as you would imagine, is a case particle usage. After all, that&#8217;s what \u3068 is in this case. And, this usage is specifically seen in between nominal phrases. Notice how the word &#8220;nominal&#8221; used instead of just &#8220;noun.&#8221; This means that you can link things with \u3084 that are grammatically made nouns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Parallel Particle \u3084<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u3084<strong>&nbsp;lists things incompletely<\/strong>.
