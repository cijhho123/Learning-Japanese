Both the topic and object markers can be replaced with&nbsp;\u3082, and the sense of &#8220;also&#8221; extends separately. So, in Ex. 9, the speaker is relating himself to the listener while also mentioning how he also heals quickly, suggesting there is another skill he is quick at.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also possible to see multiple&nbsp;\u3082 in the same sentence in the pattern&nbsp;X\u3082Y\u3082, which translates as either &#8220;both&nbsp;X and Y&#8221; or &#8220;neither X nor Y&#8221; depending on whether the sentence is positive or negative respectively. This, too, is not limited to just two words. Multiple &#8216;topics&#8217; can be chained together with a&nbsp;sequence of&nbsp;\u3082.
