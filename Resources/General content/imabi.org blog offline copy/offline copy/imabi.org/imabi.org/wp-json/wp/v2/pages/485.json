These were just basic examples, though, as many other such color words can be found in Japanese. Some can be as simple as \u8d64\u8336\u8272 (reddish brown) whereas others come from more complicated Sino-Japanese morphemes like \u7070\u767d\u8272 (greyish white).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not really important to memorize every sort of color combination as it is to know how they are generally formed and used.
