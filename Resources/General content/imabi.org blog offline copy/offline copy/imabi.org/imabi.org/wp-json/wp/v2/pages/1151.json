One meaning which has since fallen out of use is &#8220;circumstance,&#8221; and from this meaning, the suffix \u3057\u304d emerged as a means of hinting at other similar things with a tinge of contempt or a belittling effect. &#8220;Belittling&#8221; oneself is where it attained its humble nuancing in scenarios like Ex. 5.<br><br>8. \u6211\u7b49\u5f0f\u306e\u4eba\u306f\u3001\u805e\u304d\u3066\u3082\u3044\u304b\u304c\u306f<br>My, what would we do if people such as ourselves were to ask?<br>From the \u300e\u767a\u5fc3\u96c6\u300f.<br><br>9. \u4e38\u3057\u304d<sup data-fn=\"80cbd1ba-b4bf-4fc0-b40f-565d064279d0\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#80cbd1ba-b4bf-4fc0-b40f-565d064279d0\" id=\"80cbd1ba-b4bf-4fc0-b40f-565d064279d0-link\">2<\/a><\/sup>\u3092\u629b\u308a\u3051\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u7f6e\u3044\u3066\u5f80\u304d\u306a<br>Dish out the dough you got and go.<br>From \u300e\u4eba\u60c5\u672c\u30fb\u5bdd\u899a\u4e4b\u7e70\u8a00\u300f<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By deriving from the noun \u5f0f with a more literal interpretation of &#8220;circumstance,&#8221; that means that it itself may attach to \uff5e\u7a0b, with \uff5e\u7a0b\u5f0f, thus, referring to a circumstance to &#8220;this&#8221; degree in, of course, a belittling sense. So, while \u3057\u304d as an adverbial particle in Modern Japanese is limited to demonstratives with a meaning identical to \u304f\u3089\u3044\u30fb\u307b\u3069, it is not entirely the case that \uff5e\u7a0b\u5f0f is redundant. In practice, however, when \u5f0f was frequently used to mean \u4e8b\u60c5\u30fb\u6709\u69d8 in Classical Japanese, it usually appeared as a standalone noun, thus realizing as \uff5e\u306e\u5f0f outside the handful cases of it as a suffix.<br><br>10. \u3053\u306e\u307b\u3069\u306e\u5f0f\u3092\u3070\u8eab\u306b\u66ff\u3078\u3066\u3082\u7533\u3057\u5ba5\u3080\u3079\u304f\u5019\u3075<br>I would like to smooth these affairs out even if it costs me.<br>From the \u300e\u592a\u5e73\u8a18\u300f.<br><br>Incidentally, in the phrase \u5869\u6885\u5f0f, \uff5e\u5f0f simply denotes &#8220;circumstance&#8221; without any negative connotation, although it is a rarity in that regard.<br><br>11. \u307e\u305a\u3053\u3093\u306a\u5869\u6885\u5f0f\u3060\u304b\u3089\u3001\u543e\u3005\u4e00\u884c\u306e\u5931\u7b56\u7269\u7b11\u3044\u306f\u6570\u9650\u308a\u3082\u306a\u3044\u3002\u30b7\u30ac\u30fc\u3068\u30b7\u30e5\u30ac\u30fc\u3092\u9593\u9055\u3048\u3066\u7159\u8349\u3092\u8cb7\u3044\u306b\u3084\u3063\u3066\u7802\u7cd6\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u6765\u308b\u3082\u3042\u308a\u3001\u533b\u8005\u306f\u4eba\u53c2\u3068\u601d\u3063\u3066\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u6765\u3066\u751f\u59dc\u306e\u7c89\u3067\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002<br>First of all, given the circumstances, our lot made countless, laughable blunders.
