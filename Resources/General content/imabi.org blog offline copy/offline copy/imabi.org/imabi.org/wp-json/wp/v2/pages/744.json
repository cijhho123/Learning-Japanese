In 30c, the agent&#8217;s parents are viewed as the highest source of trust between the agent and that the agent did not go to the extent of even coming out to them. This reading rests on the notion that \u307e\u3067 is more akin to Usage III, which albeit irregular, is not impossible due to the agent&#8217;s situation not changing &#8211; the agent is still in the closet. 30c&#8217; is the more likely interpretation, as it applies that while the agent&#8217;s parents may still be the furthest extent coming out to may be carried out, the issue is not serious enough to warrant having to go that far; meaning, some people were told, just not to the extent of telling the parents. <br>30d. The more natural rendering of the first interpretation of 30c, the agent highly emphasizes how they didn&#8217;t even come out to their parents; however, the possibility of 30d&#8217;, although unlikely, is striking both in how it exists and how it still differs from 30c&#8217;, which rests on a far more literal interpretation of \u3055\u3048<sup data-fn=\"5aa7e451-2a3f-4db0-b2e2-1cc5ab6c1f69\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#5aa7e451-2a3f-4db0-b2e2-1cc5ab6c1f69\" id=\"5aa7e451-2a3f-4db0-b2e2-1cc5ab6c1f69-link\">4<\/a><\/sup> that has disappeared from negative sentences in modern usage, thus the X grammaticality judgment.<br>30e. is a non-ambiguous rendering of 30c&#8217;. <br>30f. is a non-ambiguous yet far heavier rendering of 30c, negating a result that the agent is culpable for not doing, which the agent will subsequently explain their reasoning for. <br>30g. The most no-strings-attached rendition, the use of \u3082 does not indicate that the choice of not coming out to their parents is extreme, but it does give the sense that their parents weren&#8217;t the only ones not told. <br>30h. With the use of \u3067\u3082, the negation is heavily stilted towards [\u89aa\u306b], but just like with \u3082, the predicate of &#8220;coming out&#8221; is not being presented as an extreme situation. <br><br>The paraphrases 30e-f are most telling as for how \u307e\u3067 and \u3055\u3048 differ in negative constructions.
