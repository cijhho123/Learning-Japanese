However, to keep things easier in our minds, we will need to treat them separately. This is because the grammar\/particle usage for each usage is quite different. These endings, \uff5e\u3089\u308c\u308b\u30fb\u308c\u308b, along with appropriate phrasing to go along, help create \u8efd\u3044\u656c\u8a9e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing when it is appropriate to only be lightly honorific is a question that natives struggle at times. It is safe to say, though, that when you are with someone you should be respectful to yet have no established connection with each other to warrant the same speech you would use to your boss, \u8efd\u3044\u656c\u8a9e becomes very useful.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ambiguity Note<\/strong>: There are times when the passive usage and the honorific usage of these endings becomes blurred. Because of this, the usage of \u8efd\u3044\u656c\u8a9e is less common in comparison to other speech styles. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u8efd\u3044\u656c\u8a9e<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we look at how this grammar is used, let&#8217;s recap on how to construct it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;Verb Class<\/td><td>&nbsp;Example Verb<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u672a\u7136\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\uff0b\u3089\u308c\u308b\u30fb\u308c\u308b<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u4e0a\u4e00\u6bb5<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u898b\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u898b-<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u4e0b\u4e00\u6bb5<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u98df\u3079\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u98df\u3079-<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u308b<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u4e94\u6bb5<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u8aad\u3080<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u8aad\u307e-<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u8aad\u307e\u308c\u308b<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u30b5\u5909<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3059\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3055-<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3055\u308c\u308b<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u30ab\u5909<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u6765\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u6765\uff08\u3053\uff09-<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u6765\u3089\u308c\u308b<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; The use of \u30ec\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30ec\u30eb\u656c\u8a9e is becoming more frowned upon as being too vague and unfitting for more and more situations. Many speakers believe that if you are to be respectful, then you should just use \u656c\u8a9e. However, many younger people overuse \u30ec\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30ec\u30eb\u656c\u8a9e and is a potential cause for \u4e8c\u91cd\u656c\u8a9e when these young people are trained to use more honorific means of expression as they combine what they have known with what they&#8217;re being told. Of course, doubling \u656c\u8a9e can come about by just being overly cautious of how respectful you&#8217;re being, but this is another motivation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not to take away from the fact that \u30ec\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30ec\u30eb\u656c\u8a9e is frequently used because it is. Just note that this is just the lowest tier of \u656c\u8a9e and that you will need to use more honorific patterns as is needed. For instance, if were are to assume that talking to your \u8ab2\u9577 and \u793e\u9577 is different, \u30ec\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30ec\u30eb\u656c\u8a9e would be proper for the former but not for the latter. In interviews there is a tendency to avoid \u30ec\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30ec\u30eb\u656c\u8a9e, but there are plenty of reporters that use it. In the end, there is a lot of speaker variation. Just keep these things in mind as you use this speech pattern.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Examples<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u305d\u306e<ruby>\u672c<\/ruby>\u306f\u3082\u3046<ruby>\u8aad<\/ruby>\u307e\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304b\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Have you already read the book?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u3069\u3061\u3089\u3067<ruby>\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e<\/ruby>\u3092<ruby>\u7fd2<\/ruby>\u308f\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3063\u3051\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where again did you learn Japanese?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><ruby>3. \u5948\u826f<\/ruby>\u306b<ruby>\u884c<\/ruby>\u304b\u308c\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Have you ever been to Nara?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u67f3\u7530\u3055\u3093\u306f\u4eca\u671d\u3001\u4ed9\u53f0\u3092\u767a\u305f\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yanagida-san left Sendai this morning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. \u4eca\u671d\u306e\u7523\u7d4c\u65b0\u805e\u3092\u8aad\u307e\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304b\u3002<br>&nbsp;\u3000 Have you read this morning&#8217;s Sankei Newspaper?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. \u304a\u9152\u3092\u98f2\u307e\u308c\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>\u3000\u3000Do you drink?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. \u3069\u3061\u3089\u306b\u4f4f\u3093\u3067\u304a\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Where do you live?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. \u3053\u306e\u8a18\u4e8b\u3092\u3069\u3046\u601d\u308f\u308c\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3002&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; What do you think about the article?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9. \u5148\u751f\u304c\u6765\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The teacher has come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10. \u4f55\u6642\u306b\u51fa\u767a\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At what time will you depart?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11. \u9234\u6728\u526f\u8ab2\u9577\u306f\u671d\u4f55\u6642\u306b\u8d77\u304d\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304b\u3002<br>\u3000&nbsp; What time in the morning did Chief Suzuki wake up?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12. \u5148\u751f\u3082\u884c\u304b\u308c\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3002\uff08\u3007\u30fb\uff1f\u30fbX\uff09<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will you go too, Sensei?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sentence Note<\/strong>: For those who believe \u30ec\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30ec\u30eb\u656c\u8a9e should be used towards a figure like \u5148\u751f, this sentence is wrong.

In the first sentence, one could argue that if traditional particle alignment (\u304c instead of \u3092 for the object of a potential verb) were used that the second interpretation would not be likely. In reality, little distinction is made between using \u304c or \u3092 to mark the object of a potential verb. So, the second interpretation is totally plausible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>15. \u8cc7\u6599\u3092\u898b\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304b\u3002<br>\u3000\u3000 Did you see the material?<br>\u3000\u3000 Could you see the material?<br>\u3000\u3000 Was the material seen?

However, because the use of the traditional potential form would be more formal, this causes both interpretations below to be plausible. If the purpose of \u656c\u8a9e is to be both respectful and clear, then there will be instances in which you should not leave room for misinterpretation.
