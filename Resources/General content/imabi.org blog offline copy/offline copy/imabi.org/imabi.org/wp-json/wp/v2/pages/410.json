Though both \u7c21\u5358\u306a and \u3084\u3055\u3057\u3044 overlap in describing things that may be easy to comprehend, the former simply indicates the simplicity of something whereas the latter suggests that the situation is still easily comprehensible even if carrying the situation out may still pose a challenge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u304c\u3084\u3055\u3057\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3046\u306e\u306f\u5653\u3060\u3088\u306d\u3002<br>Saying that Japanese is easy is a lie.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if it were relatively easy for someone to learn Japanese, and even if the person weren&#8217;t struggling to comprehend the grammar and how to use words, learning a language itself is still a major undertaking. In that sense, Japanese would&nbsp;certainly not be \u7c21\u5358.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ii. Where \u305f\u3084\u3059\u3044 and \u5bb9\u6613\u306a differ from the others is that though they refer to &#8220;easy&#8221; situations, the plain and simple they reference may not actually cut it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. \u3010\u305f\u3084\u3059\u3044\u30fb\u5bb9\u6613\u306a\u3011\u3053\u3068\u3067\u306f\u3068\u3066\u3082\u5230\u9054\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>There&#8217;s no way one will attain it through [simple\/[plain]&nbsp;means.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>iii. Loanwords from English abound in Japanese, and many speakers have this rather unfounded fear that these words are slowly eating away at existing words for the same things. However, in the case of \u30a4\u30fc\u30b8\u30fc\u306a, it has already adapted its unique Japanese-made nuances which at first glance bear resemblance to &#8220;easy&#8221; but could just as easily or more naturally be worded as something else in English proper.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. \u30b9\u30ed\u30fc\u3067\u30a4\u30fc\u30b8\u30fc\u306a\u30eb\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u3067\u904e\u3054\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002<br>I have a slow and easy\/carefree routine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9. \u30a4\u30fc\u30b8\u30fc\u3067\u5c65\u304d\u5fc3\u5730\u306e\u3044\u3044\u30d1\u30f3\u30c4\u3092\u5c65\u304f\u306e\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>I love wearing underpants that are&nbsp;simple\/handy and feel good.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>iv. You may have noticed that \u7c21\u6613 was in the chart with the meaning of &#8220;simple\/convenient.&#8221; It is just one of still many other synonyms out there. However, because the remaining synonyms are more nuanced and advanced in nature, we will leave those words to our second instillation of this topic.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>v. We learned at the start of this section that \u7c21\u5358\u306a has&nbsp;more than one meaning&nbsp;and that words in general are guilty of this nuance game. English words are just as&nbsp;guilty. Think about the word&nbsp;&#8220;easy.&#8221; What is meant by, &#8220;he&#8217;s so easy&#8221;? Were you talking about the guy being &#8220;easily tricked&#8221; or about how he&#8217;s &#8220;promiscuous&#8221;? Either way, the Japanese &#8216;options&#8217; and their implications would be just as varied.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even then, we still would just be touching the surface on the other numerous idioms and various other meanings of the word &#8220;easy&#8221; that cannot just be paraphrased with a synonym like &#8220;simple.&#8221; These nuances would, understandably, require different Japanese translations.

When written with the Kanji&nbsp;\u6613, it had the meaning of &#8220;simple&#8221; and &#8220;easygoing.&#8221; However, even when&nbsp;\u5b89 was used, it could still mean &#8220;carefree,&#8221; and by extension,&nbsp;people of no value due to their carefree nature, which led to the broad meaning of&nbsp;&#8220;cheap.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, its meaning of &#8220;easy&#8221; lives on in \uff5e\u3084\u3059\u3044, an ending that attaches to the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 of verbs as follows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>Verb Class<\/strong><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>&nbsp;\uff0b\uff5e\u3084\u3059\u3044<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u4e00\u6bb5 Verbs<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u7740\u3084\u3059\u3044 (easy to wear)&nbsp;<br>\u98df\u3079\u3084\u3059\u3044 (easy to eat)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u4e94\u6bb5 Verbs&nbsp;<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u98fc\u3044\u3084\u3059\u3044 (easy to raise (animal))<br>\u66f8\u304d\u3084\u3059\u3044 (easy to write)<br>\u6cf3\u304e\u3084\u3059\u3044 (easy to swim)<br>\u8a71\u3057\u3084\u3059\u3044 (easy to talk)<br>\u52dd\u3061\u3084\u3059\u3044 (easy to win)<br>\u6b7b\u306b\u3084\u3059\u3044 (to easily die)<br>\u8aad\u307f\u3084\u3059\u3044 (easy to read)<br>\u58f2\u308a\u3084\u3059\u3044 (easy to sell)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u3059\u308b<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u3057\u3084\u3059\u3044 (easy to do)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u6765\u308b<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u6765\uff08\u304d\uff09\u3084\u3059\u3044 (easy to come)<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>22. \u304a\u7bb8\u3067\u306f\u98df\u3079\u3084\u3059\u3044\u3088\u3002<br>(It)&#8217;s easy to eat with chopsticks.<br><br>23. \u4eba\u9593\u306f\u6b7b\u306b\u3084\u3059\u3044\u52d5\u7269\u3060\u3002<br>Humans are animals that easily die.<br><br>24. \u3053\u306e\u5834\u6240\u306f\u57fc\u7389\u304b\u3089\u6765\u3084\u3059\u3044\u3088\u3002<br>This place is easy to arrive at from Saitama.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>25. \u8aac\u660e\u81ea\u4f53\u306f\u9577\u3044\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3051\u3069\u3001\u300c\u3044\u307e\u3073\u300d\u5148\u751f\u306e\u8aac\u660e\u306f\u4ed6\u306e\u5148\u751f\u3088\u308a\u308f\u304b\u308a\u3084\u3059\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>Although the explanations themselves might be long, IMABI Sensei&#8217;s explanations are easier to understand than other those of other sensei.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>26. \u300c\u5c71\u300d\u3068\u3044\u3046\u5b57\u306f\u5b9f\u969b\u306e\u5c71\u3068\u5f62\u304c\u4f3c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3001\u899a\u3048\u3084\u3059\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d\u3002<br>The character &#8220;\u5c71&#8221; is easy to remember because its shape resembles an actual mountain, huh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>27. \u3053\u306e\u554f\u984c\u306f\u9593\u9055\u3048\u3084\u3059\u3044\u304b\u3089\u3088\u30fc\u304f\u6ce8\u610f\u3057\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002<br>This problem is easy to mess up, so please pay very clo~se attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Particle Use<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\uff5e\u3084\u3059\u3044 can be described as having two distinct nuances depending on the volition or lack thereof implied by the verb.

Replacing \u3092 with \u304c in either of the next two sentences would alter the meaning and make the sentences unnatural. Moreover, when attached to transitive verbs, we find that \u3092 appears regardless of whether the agent is willfully acting or not as the subject-transitive predicate still has an object. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>35. \u305d\u306e\u83cc\u3092\u6bba\u3057\u3084\u3059\u3044\u6297\u751f\u7269\u8cea\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3068\u52b9\u679c\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002(Volitional Verb)<br>There will be no effect if it isn&#8217;t an antibiotic that will&nbsp;easily kill that bacteria.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To use \u304c naturally after \u83cc, you would need to use the potential form of \u6bba\u3059, which \u6bba\u305b\u308b. The reason why a speaker would opt for \u6bba\u3057\u3084\u3059\u3044 instead of the potential form would be to emphasize how &#8216;\u5bb9\u6613\u306b&#8217; the antibiotic needs to act. Antibiotics do not have minds of their own, but if they do not work with ease, the bacteria could gain the upper hand. By using the otherwise volitional verb \u6bba\u3059, though, the speaker is personifying the antibiotic as an agent. The use of \u3092 here actually mimics how it is used with the potential form, and although the morphology of \uff5e\u3084\u3059\u3044 is adjectival, the phrase \u6bba\u3057\u3084\u3059\u3044 in this sentence maintains a verbal quality.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>36. \u6574\u7406\u6574\u9813\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304c\u82e6\u624b\u306a\u4eba\u306b\u306f\u3088\u304f\u7269\u3092\u843d\u3068\u3057\u3084\u3059\u3044\u50be\u5411\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002<br>There is a tendency in people who are bad at organizing to easily drop things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this sentence, it is not the case that the items are easily dropped. Rather, the people drop things habitually. The habit, in turn, is what easily occurs. Thus, these instances can be rationalized no differently than Exs. 28-29.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\uff5e\u3089\u308c\u3084\u3059\u3044<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having looked at the last few examples, it might strike you as odd that \uff5e\u3084\u3059\u3044 would be combined with \uff5e\uff08\u3089\uff09\u308c\u308b. Yet, there are plenty of examples of this.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>37. \u4eba\u306b\u9854\u3092\u899a\u3048\u3089\u308c\u3084\u3059\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>People easily remember my face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this sentence, the passive voice is used in the Japanese version, but it is no different in meaning than the English active voice equivalent. When the passive voice is intended with \uff5e\u3084\u3059\u3044, the verb is non-volitional in nature, meaning that \uff5e\u3084\u3059\u3044 is showing the ease in tendency.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In &#8216;correct&#8217; grammar, \uff5e\u3084\u3059\u3044 should not be used with potential verbs as that would be redundant. Although examples of this can be heard, it is mostly frowned upon. The potential for confusion between whether the potential or passive sense is meant only occurs with \u4e00\u6bb5 verbs as examples of \uff5e\u3084\u3059\u3044 with \u4e94\u6bb5 verbs simply don&#8217;t exist in natural, proper speech. This is indicative of \uff5e\uff08\u3089\uff09\u308c\u3084\u3059\u3044 being restricted to the passive sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further proof of this is how \u51fa\u6765\u3084\u3059\u3044 is interpreted. Although \u51fa\u6765\u308b can mean &#8220;can do,&#8221; it also has the broader meaning of &#8220;to be made,&#8221; which is how it is interpreted when used with \uff5e\u3084\u3059\u3044.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>38. \u9752\u75e3\u304c\u51fa\u6765\u3084\u3059\u3044\u3002<br>I easily bruise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>39. \u5c3f\u8def\u7d50\u77f3\u304c\u51fa\u6765\u3084\u3059\u3044\u3002<br>I easily get kidney stones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>40. \u53e3\u5185\u708e\u304c\u51fa\u6765\u3084\u3059\u3044\u3002<br>I get mouth ulcers easily.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Easy I: \uff5e\u3084\u3059\u3044 It would be easy enough to learn how to say &#8220;easy&#8221; if it weren&#8217;t for the fact t<a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/imabi.org\/easy-i-%ef%bd%9e%e3%82%84%e3%81%99%e3%81%84\/\">\u7d9a\u304d\u3092\u8aad\u3080 <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">&#8220;Easy I: \uff5e\u3084\u3059\u3044&#8221;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":158153075,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"footnotes":""},"tags":[],"class_list":["post-410","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry"],"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/PeXUlI-6C","jetpack-related-posts":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/410","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/158153075"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=410"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/410\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4851,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/410\/revisions\/4851"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=410"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=410"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
