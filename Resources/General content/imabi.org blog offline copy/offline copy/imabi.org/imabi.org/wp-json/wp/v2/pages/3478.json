Which is to say, the exclamatory \u308f seen here in female speech ought to be viewed as a sub-use of the final particle \u308f meant to mark surprise (\u9a5a\u304d), exclamation (\u611f\u52d5), and\/or admiration (\u8a60\u5606)<sup data-fn=\"af5087ba-1871-4f2f-9cf7-d0a5a0a4de37\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#af5087ba-1871-4f2f-9cf7-d0a5a0a4de37\" id=\"af5087ba-1871-4f2f-9cf7-d0a5a0a4de37-link\">3<\/a><\/sup>. all of which are functions borne from its shared etymology with the topic marker \u306f. <br><br>Meaning, the first female speakers to incorporate \u308f into the female speech fad of the time would have already exhibited \u308f as a tone modifier; what made <em>this<\/em> \u308f so different was both its high-pitched intonation and its overuse to highlight the femininity of the speaker. To these female speakers, \u3060\u308f served as the assertive counterpart to the not-so-assertive \u3066\u3088 . Then, when coupled with \u3088 and\/or \u306d as well as after politeness markers (\uff5e\u3067\u3059\u30fb\uff5e\u307e\u3059), the bubbly, girlish emotions were further highlighted, which also happens to be a major reflection of how modern speakers remember this speech style overall: cutesy, well-off young lady (\u304a\u5b22\u3055\u3093), and with just the right tone of voice, the embodiment of a \u826f\u59bb\u8ce2\u6bcd (good wife and wise mother).<br><br>10. \u672c\u5f53\u306b\u697d\u3057\u3044\u308f\u3088\u306d\u3002<br>It sure is fun, isn&#8217;t it?<br><br>11. \u8ca0\u3051\u307e\u305b\u3093\u308f\u3088\u3002<br>I won&#8217;t lose, you know? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Discerning The Gender Role of \u308f<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Putting aside intonation and other aforementioned indicators of feminine speech, tone is the greatest indicator as to whether you are dealing with the gender-neutral \u308f or the uber-feminine \u308f. Consider the following:<br><br>12. \u4eca\u304b\u3089\u884c\u304f\u306e\u306f\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u5acc\u3060\u308f\u3002<br>Eh, I&#8217;m just not digging going (there) right this moment. <br><br>13a. \u3042\u306e\u304a\u6d0b\u670d\u3001\u30db\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u7d20\u6575\u3060\u308f\u3002<br>13b. \u3042\u306e\u304a\u6d0b\u670d\u3001\u30db\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u7d20\u6575\u3067\u3059\u308f\u3002<br>Those clothes are SO lovely!<br><br>In speech, it would be readily apparent that the \u308f in Ex. 12 has a falling intonation, whereas the \u308f in Ex. 13. As for the reason why \u308f is used in either sentence, we see that there is a stark difference. In Ex. 12, \u308f lessens the declarative tone of the predicate, but in Ex. 13, it does the exact opposite. <br><br>Ex. 13b also demonstrates how if any other markedly &#8216;feminine&#8217; wording is used, the femininity of the sentence increases so much that the gender identity of a male speaker would be put into question. <br><br>Another take-away from these examples is the choice in adverbs used to accompany the predicate. Whereas \u30db\u30f3\u30c8\u306b helps to highlight the exclamatory tone of the sentence along with the feminine \u308f in 13, \u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068 makes it clear that, although certainly interjecting emotion into the sentence, \u308f is gender-neutral. <br><br>In either case, \u3060\uff0b\u308f is not inherently feminine. It is the overly emphatic declarative tone that \u308f may have which causes it to sound feminine. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Use of \u308f in Today&#8217;s Speech<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As for how widespread the particle \u308f is in either case, many speakers view its feminine iteration as a dying aspect (\u6b7b\u8a9e) of Tokyo Dialect and that the gender-neutral version is more common outside of the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan area (\u9996\u90fd\u570f). Certainly, in Western Japanese dialects, \u308f does have a greater range of emotional effects to an utterance, but the particle&#8217;s ubiquity since its appearance renders these opinions not so much wrong as they are reflections on how it has been associated with ever-changing personae. <br><br>14. \u672c\u5f53\u306b\u56f0\u3063\u305f\u308f\u3002(Gender Neutral)<br>I&#8217;m really in a rut. <br><br>15. \u884c\u304f\u308f\u3088\uff01(Feminine)<br>Here I go!<br><br>16. \u3042\u3068\u306e\u4e8b\u306f\u4f55\u308c\u6771\u4eac\u3078\u51fa\u305f\u3089\u3001\u9022\u3063\u305f\u4e0a\u3067\u8a71\u3092\u4ed8\u3051<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u3089\u3042<\/span>\u3002(Dialectal; Gender-Neutral)<br>I\u2019ll talk about that once I\u2019ve gone and met (with him). &nbsp;<br>From\u300e\u9580 \u300fby \u590f\u76ee\u6f31\u77f3.<br><br><strong>Contraction Note<\/strong>: The &#8220;\u3089\u3042&#8221; seen in Ex. is in fact an example of the final particle \u308f fusing with the verb-ending morpheme \/ru\/.
