It is most frequently used with verbs related to acceptance belief, thought, and understanding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\uff5e\u304c\u305f\u3044 is most appropriate in \u66f8\u304d\u8a00\u8449, or in a tone that is similar in nature.

However, because \uff5e\u306b\u304f\u3044 is overwhelmingly written in Kana, whenever you do see \uff5e\u96e3\u3044, it is usually read as \u304c\u305f\u3044 unless the use of \uff5e\u306b\u304f\u3044 would be more natural.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Verb Class<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;\uff0b\u304c\u305f\u3044<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\u4e00\u6bb5\u3000Verbs<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u907f\u3051<strong>\u304c\u305f\u3044<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u4e94\u6bb5 Verbs<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u8a31\u3057<strong>\u304c\u305f\u3044<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u3059\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3057<strong>\u304c\u305f\u3044<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Etymology Note<\/strong>: This ending derives from the Classical Japanese adjective \u96e3\uff08\u304b\u305f\uff09\u3057.

The degree of &#8220;emotional strain&#8221; can vary from agony to just being burdensome.

In the case of \u8a00\u3044\u306b\u304f\u3044, the speaker is most likely referring to a situation that&#8217;s hard to pinpoint. \u8a00\u3044\u304c\u305f\u3044, on the other hand, is a situation that the speaker has a strong urge not to discuss. \u8a00\u3044\u3065\u3089\u3044, is similar to \u8a00\u3044\u304c\u305f\u3044, but implies that the topic is rather painful for them to mention.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike \uff5e\u304c\u305f\u3044, so long as the act being described can be conceptualized in a way that it is &#8216;difficult&#8217; to the speaker or agent in an emotional way, using \uff5e\u3065\u3089\u3044 can still be grammatical. However, if the verb purely describes physical difficulty, it is just as ungrammatical to use \uff5e\u3065\u3089\u3044 as it would be to use \uff5e\u304c\u305f\u3044. For instance, \u6ed1\u308a\u3065\u3089\u3044 is not correct.
