As we learned, case particles attach to a noun to mark a particular grammatical function (case). The function that the particle \u3092 marks, as we will learn, is to mark the direct object of a sentence. The grammatical case that it represents is called the accusative case (\u5bfe\u683c).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get into the actual grammar of all this, let&#8217;s recap some important terminology that we have seen thus far while adding these new concepts to the list.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Case Particle<\/strong>:<em>&nbsp;A particle that attaches to a noun to mark a particular grammatical function\/case.<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Verb<\/strong>: <em>A word that describes an action, state, or occurrence.

For instance, it is frequently pronounced as \u201cwo\u201d in clearly enunciated speech as well as in&nbsp;music.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a Direct Object?\u3000<br>\u76f4\u63a5\u76ee\u7684\u8a9e\u3068\u306f\uff1f<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, a&nbsp;<strong>direct object<\/strong>&nbsp;<em>is a noun phrase denoting a person or thing that is the recipient of the action of a transitive verb<\/em>. Putting aside what a transitive verb is, below are examples of direct objects in English.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>i. I kissed&nbsp;<strong>a boy<\/strong>.<br>ii. I ate&nbsp;<strong>a hamburger<\/strong>.<br>iii. I drank&nbsp;<strong>milk<\/strong>.<br>iv. She bought&nbsp;<strong>a television<\/strong>.<br>v. He sold&nbsp;<strong>his stereo<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Intransitive vs Transitive<\/strong><br>\u81ea\u52d5\u8a5e vs <strong>\u4ed6\u52d5\u8a5e<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question is what a transitive verb is, but in figuring this out, it is best to understand what transitive and intransitive verbs are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Intransitive Verb<\/strong>:&nbsp;<em>A verb that does not need an object to complete its meaning.<\/em><br><strong>Transitive Verb<\/strong>:&nbsp;<em>A verb that requires one or more objects to complete its meaning.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some examples of both intransitive and transitive verbs in English.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>vi. I saw a monkey. (transitive)<br>vii. He stood still. (intransitive)<br>viii. He found a raccoon. (transitive)<br>ix. The alligator swam away. (intransitive)<br>x. She cooked the meal. (transitive)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Japanese, intransitive verbs are called&nbsp;\u81ea\u52d5\u8a5e. Such verbs only require that a subject be used in concert with the predicate, and of course, the subject is marked by&nbsp;\u304c. Transitive verbs are called&nbsp;\u4ed6\u52d5\u8a5e. Such verbs require that both a subject and direct object be used in concert with the predicate. Although the subject is still marked by&nbsp;\u304c, the direct object is marked by&nbsp;\u3092. The fact that&nbsp;\u4ed6\u52d5\u8a5e need one more element (argument) to the sentence to be grammatical, the presence of a direct object or lack thereof, is frequently used to distinguish&nbsp;\u81ea\u52d5\u8a5e and&nbsp;\u4ed6\u52d5\u8a5e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, it is often the case that the subject of an intransitive predicate can become the direct object of a transitive predicate. This is also the case in English, which can be seen in the following examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u96fb\u6c17\u304c\u3064\u3044\u305f\u3002(Intransitive)<br>The lights turned on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u30b8\u30a7\u30a4\u30e0\u30ba\u3055\u3093\u304c\u96fb\u6c17\u3092\u3064\u3051\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002(Transitive)<br>James turned on the light.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note how the subject of Ex. 1 is the direct object of Ex. 2. Likewise, the subject of Ex. 3 is the direct object of Ex. 4.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u30d3\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u51b7\u3048\u305f\u3002(Intransitive)<br>The beer chilled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u96c4\u592a\u541b\u304c\u30d3\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u51b7\u3084\u3057\u305f\u3002(Transitive)<br>Yuta chilled the beer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Intransitive-Transitive Verb Pairs<br>\u81ea\u52d5\u8a5e\u3068\u4ed6\u52d5\u8a5e\u306e\u30da\u30a2\uff08\u81ea\u4ed6\u306e\u30da\u30a2\uff09<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In English, the verbs \u201cto turn on\u201d and \u201cto chill\u201d can be both used as either intransitive or transitive verbs without any change to their conjugations; however, the same cannot be said for Japanese. &#8220;To turn on&#8221; is&nbsp;\u3064\u304f and&nbsp;\u3064\u3051\u308b for the intransitive and transitive sense respectively, and &#8220;to chill&#8221; is&nbsp;\u51b7\u3048\u308b and&nbsp;\u51b7\u3084\u3059 in the intransitive and transitive sense respectively.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Japanese, many verbs have intransitive-transitive verb pairs, which is another means of figuring out when and when not to use the particle&nbsp;<em>wo<\/em>&nbsp;\u3092. Some of the most common examples of these so-called intransitive-transitive verb pairs in Japanese are listed below.
