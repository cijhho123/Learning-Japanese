In this lesson, we will be learning how the particle \u306b marks the agent of such predicates.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stative-transitive predicates<\/strong>&nbsp;are&nbsp;<em>predicates that describe states\/conditions but still have objects<\/em>.&nbsp;The term itself presents a dynamic often missed when discussing transitivity and the concepts of \u201cobject\u201d and \u201cagent.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The \u201c<strong>agent<\/strong>\u201d is&nbsp;<em>either the cause or the initiator\/doer of the sentence<\/em>. In the context of this lesson, only the latter purpose will be relevant. A doer doesn\u2019t always have to be actively doing anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, when an animal \u201cneeds\u201d food, it has no control over its need for sustenance, but grammatically speaking, \u201cfood\u201d is the object of the verb \u201cto need.\u201d In English, \u201canimals need food\u201d is easily explained as involving the transitive verb \u201cto need\u201d and its object \u201cfood,\u201d but in Japanese, the primary equivalent of \u201cto need\u201d is \u8981\u308b.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Japanese, \u8981\u308b is categorized as a \u81ea\u52d5\u8a5e. This is because the object is marked with \u304c. The concept of \u201cobject\u201d becomes befuddled here, though, because \u304c for all other kinds of predicates marks the subject.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u304a<ruby>\u91d1<rt>\u304b\u306d<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c<ruby>\u8981<rt>\u3044<\/rt><\/ruby>\u308b\u3002<br>i. Money is needed.<br>ii. I need money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\uff5e\u304c\u8981\u308b can be interpreted as being no different as is evident in translation i. Regardless of whether \u304c is a subject or object marker here, \u304a\u91d1 is not the agent. The understood \u201cI\u201d is. An agent\/doer, though, need not be the subject of a sentence. The same can be said in English such as in passive expressions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>i. [The man] was chased by \/the dog\/ for hours.<br>ii. [The cat] was sold to \/an elderly couple\/.<br>iii. [The turtle] was released back into the ocean by \/its rescuers\/.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In these sentences, the nouns in [] are subjects and the nouns in \/\/ are agents. If we were to view the \u304c with stative-transitive verbs as a subject marker, then the verbs would remarkably resemble passive verbs. After all, \u201cneeded\u201d is the passive form of \u201cto need,\u201d and translation i. could easily be reworded as \u201cMoney is needed by me.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question to ask is how the \u201cagent\u201d of these predicates is marked by \u306b.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;<ruby>\u541b<rt>\u304d\u307f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e\u3044\u308b<ruby>\u5834\u6240<rt>\u3070\u3057\u3087<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c<ruby>\u50d5<rt>\u307c\u304f<\/rt><\/ruby><strong>\u306b\u306f<\/strong>\u308f\u304b\u308b\u3093\u3060\u3002<br>i. I know where you are.<br>ii. Where you are is known by me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In English, translation ii. is strange, but it\u2019s exactly how Japanese expresses the emotion that can be felt in the English of translation i. The use of \u306b exemplifies \u50d5 as the agent of knowledge concerning [\u541b\u306e\u3044\u308b\u5834\u6240]. The use of \u306b, however, is not obligatory. As such, Ex. 2 can be reworded as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;<ruby>\u50d5<rt>\u307c\u304f<\/rt><\/ruby><strong>\u306f<\/strong><ruby>\u541b<rt>\u304d\u307f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e\u3044\u308b<ruby>\u5834\u6240<rt>\u3070\u3057\u3087<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c\u308f\u304b\u308b\u3002<br>I know where you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nuance-wise, Exs. 2 and 3 are almost the same. However, Ex. 2 is more emphatic. Grammatically speaking, the \u201cagent\u201d of both Ex. 2 and Ex. 3 is \u50d5. Just as we learned in Lesson 12, the particle \u306f, when it is in fact the topic marker, is best understood as only marking the topic. As such, the deep structure (the form of a sentence that represents the interworking grammar in the mind) of Ex. 3 would still, in fact, look like: \u201cboku-wa (\u00f8-ni) kimi-no iru basho-ga wakaru.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motivation for why the particle \u306b marks the agent of a sentence can be found in its basic use of denoting the place where something exists. Although long-winded and not representative of typical speech, one could say \u201cit is within me where the knowledge of your location resides.\u201d By extension of this, one can view the particle \u306b as purposely marking the existence of an agent\/doer as agent\/doer = someone. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will now look at each verbal stative-transitive predicate that uses \u306b to optionally mark the agent. This is a precursor to the next lesson in which we\u2019ll finally learn about the passive form of verbs where \u306b obligatorily marks the agent of a sentence.&nbsp;The verbs to be discussed in this lesson are as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u30fb\u5206\u304b\u308b<br>\u30fb\u805e\u3053\u3048\u308b<br>\u30fb\u898b\u3048\u308b<br>\u30fb\u3042\u308b<br>\u30fb\u3044\u308b<br>\u30fb\u51fa\u6765\u308b<br>\u30fb\u8981\u308b<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you already have a basic understanding of what these verbs mean and how they\u2019re used, each section will mainly focus on particle issues the agent-marker \u306b presents in relation to other kinds of \u306b and other particles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Particle Note<\/strong>: The agent-marking function of \u306b is most often accompanied with the contrast-marker \u306f. When one feels it is necessary to explicitly state the agent, one is doing so because the natural happenstance of the verb is tied to the person being stated in contrast with others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u5206\u304b\u308b<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The verb \u308f\u304b\u308b, as we have learned, refers to non-intentional, natural understanding. Its lack of volition is why Japanese categorizes it as a \u81ea\u52d5\u8a5e. &nbsp;The basic patterns a sentence can take with \u308f\u304b\u308b are as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2460X\u306fY\u304c\u308f\u304b\u308b<br>\u2461X\u306b\uff08\u306f\uff09Y\u304c\u308f\u304b\u308b<br>\u2462X\u306fY\u3092\u308f\u304b\u308b<br><br>In these patterns, \u201cY\u201d is understood to be an \u201cobject.\u201d Even if it can be conceptualized as a \u201csubject\u201d due to the use of \u304c to mark it, \u201cX\u201d is what is conceptualized as the subject, and as such, the exhaustive-listing function of \u304c can be used to mark X. This can be seen in Exs. 13 and 14 below. It is also impossible to forget how there are indeed cases when the object of \u308f\u304b\u308b is indeed marked by \u3092 when the verb itself is no longer treated as being non-volitional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, however, it is Pattern 2 that is the basic pattern of \u308f\u304b\u308b. Pattern 1 is simply a derivative with the marking of the agent treated as an unspoken, understood element.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Examples<\/u><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4.&nbsp;<ruby>\u5206<rt>\u308f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304b\u308b<ruby>\u4eba<rt>\u3072\u3068<\/rt><\/ruby><strong>\u306b\u306f<\/strong><ruby>\u5206<rt>\u308f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304b\u308b\u3051\u3069\u3001<ruby>\u5206<rt>\u308f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044<ruby>\u4eba<rt>\u3072\u3068<\/rt><\/ruby><strong>\u306b\u306f<\/strong><ruby>\u5168<rt>\u307e\u3063\u305f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304f<ruby>\u5206<rt>\u308f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044<ruby>\u8a71<rt>\u306f\u306a\u3057<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3092\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>I&#8217;m going to talk about something that will be understood by those who understand it but will be totally not understood by those who don\u2019t understand it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Particle Note<\/strong>: \u306b\u306f is obligatory.

Provided \u3092 marks \u672c\u5f53\u306e\u3042\u306a\u305f as the object, the following \u79c1 would typically be marked with \u304c as it is established via \u3092 that \u308f\u304b\u308b is being treated as a typical transitive verb. \u306b\u306f can still be used to mark \u79c1 in this situation, but the sentence would go from sounding like \u201cIt is indeed I who doesn\u2019t understand the true you\u201d to \u201cOthers may, but it is not I who understands the true you.\u201d&nbsp;<br>3.

Whereas the \u306b that follows X is the agent-marking function, the \u306b after Z indicates an (indirect) object of comparison.

If cancelling out the nuance of volition is not possible, then so too is the use of \u306b\u306f in that circumstance. To demonstrate this, consider Ex. 56. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>56.&nbsp;<ruby>\u79c1<rt>\u308f\u305f\u3057<\/rt><\/ruby><strong>\uff08\u306b\u306f ??\u30fb\u306f \u3007\uff09<\/strong>\u30c6\u30cb\u30b9\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3088\u3002<br>I can play tennis!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it is not entirely ungrammatical to use \u306b\u306f to mark \u79c1 as the agent of this sentence due to \u3067\u304d\u308b being a stative-transitive predicate at its basic understanding, it is incredibly unnatural here because the strong volitional nuance of the transitive\u3059\u308b.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though at this point it goes without saying, there are two basic sentence patterns involving potential phrases, which are as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2460X\u306b\uff08\u306f\uff09Y\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b<br>\u2461X\u306fY\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for \u2460, \u306b is typically only seen when in a dependent clause were \u201cX\u201d is only present to directly modify \u201cY,\u201d or when \u201cY\u201d and \u201cX\u201d flip places. Having \u306b directly next to the predicate helps emphasize the agent to the point that \u306f isn\u2019t needed unless one wishes to also contrast the agent with other people. Otherwise, \u306b\u306f is typically seen. \u2460 is frequently employed when showing the inherent abilities of one agent over that of another (Exs. 59 and 61). Another reason for using \u306b\u306f is when \u306f is used as the contrast-marker and not as the topic marker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for \u2461, this is the most common pattern for potential phrases because most people generally imply volitional control of the execution of their abilities. As we have already seen with Ex. 56, the presence of this nuance will cause \u306b\u306f to sound unnatural. Because we have already seen plenty of examples of \u2461 in previous lessons, all the examples below will be of \u2460.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Examples<\/u><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>57.&nbsp;<ruby>\u79c1<rt>\u308f\u305f\u3057<\/rt><\/ruby><strong>\u306b<\/strong>\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u306a\u3093\u3060\u308d\u3046\u3002<br>i.

This \u306b marks a purpose\/reason for an action\/state. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>72.&nbsp;<ruby>\u904b\u547d<rt>\u3046\u3093\u3081\u3044<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e<ruby>\u4eba<rt>\u3072\u3068<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306b<ruby>\u51fa\u4f1a<rt>\u3067\u3042<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3046\u305f\u3081<strong>\u306b<\/strong>\u3001<ruby>\u4eca<rt>\u3044\u307e<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e<ruby>\u79c1<rt>\u308f\u305f\u3057<\/rt><\/ruby><strong>\u306b<\/strong><ruby>\u5fc5\u8981<rt>\u3072\u3064\u3088\u3046<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306a\u3053\u3068\u306f<ruby>\u4f55<rt>\u306a\u3093<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\u3002<br>What is it that my current self needs to meet my soulmate?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Particle Note<\/strong>: Thematically, both \u306b in bold can be viewed as marking purpose\/reason.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>73. \u30ae\u30bf\u30fc\u3092<ruby>\u59cb<rt>\u306f\u3058<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3081\u308b<strong>\u306e\u306b<\/strong><ruby>\u5fc5\u8981<rt>\u3072\u3064\u3088\u3046<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306a\u3082\u306e\u3092\u307e\u3068\u3081\u3066\u307f\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I\u2019ve tried to compile the things necessary for beginning guitar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The greatest cliffhanger in the introduction of this lesson was the lack of a Japanese translation for \u201canimals need food.\u201d Without further ado, the translation of this sentence is as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>74.&nbsp;<ruby>\u52d5\u7269<rt>\u3069\u3046\u3076\u3064<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c<ruby>\u751f<rt>\u3044<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304d\u308b<strong>\u306b\u306f<\/strong><ruby>\u98df\u7269<rt>\u3057\u3087\u304f\u3082\u3064<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c<ruby>\u8981<rt>\u3044<\/rt><\/ruby>\u308b\u3002<br>i.

This \u306b\u306f is thematically the same as the ones in Exs. 72 and 73, making it equivalent to \u201cfor\/to.\u201d The reason why \u306b\u306f can directly follow a verb is that the verb is actually nominalized as an effect. This makes \u306b\u306f equal to \u306e\u306b\uff08\u306f\uff09.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three translations above tie back to various things detailed in this lesson. The insertion of \uff5e\u304c\u751f\u304d\u308b re-purposes \u306b as the purpose-marker because \u52d5\u7269 isn&#8217;t&nbsp;a true agent. However, because \u751f\u304d\u308b ends up being nominalized, it is not illogical to treat this as an extension of the agent-marker \u306b. In fact, it\u2019s contexts like these where the purpose-marker \u306b likely derived. A way to conceptualize this as such is translating Ex. 74 as \u201cThe state of animals living requires that there be food.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>75.&nbsp;<ruby>\u4eba<rt>\u3072\u3068<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c<ruby>\u751f<rt>\u3044<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304d\u308b<strong>\u306b\u306f<\/strong><ruby>\u610f\u5473<rt>\u3044\u307f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u305d\u3057\u3066<ruby>\u4fa1\u5024<rt>\u304b\u3061<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c\u3042\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>There is meaning and value to people living.<br><br><strong>Particle Note<\/strong>: The relation between \u306b\u306f and \u3042\u308b can be interpreted as both being its existential and its possessive meaning.
