These phrases often repeat in cyclical fashion. For instance, \u671d means &#8220;morning,&#8221; and morning is bound to occur tomorrow, but as for from when to when is considered morning, that will be subject to context. <br><br>Words that fall into this category are most notably followed by \u306b, but the conditions mentioned in the last lesson in which \u306b may be dropped still hold true:<br><br>i. When a non-deictic expression modifies a noun, \u306e\u2014not \u306b\u2014is used, as it is being used as an attribute. Furthermore, \u306b\u306e is invalid because multiple case particles can never be used on the same noun simultaneously. <br>ii. Topicalizing a non-deictic expression often results in \u306b being dropped because the particle \u306f already heightens its adverbial nature. <br>iii. When a deictic expression modifies a non-deictic expression, \u306b ought not be present except when a contrast is being made or when there is a clear reference point like a date on a calendar or when telling time.<br>iv. When the events of the main clause are given greater semantic weight in the sentence, \u306b is often dropped. This is especially so when non-deictic expressions are in sentence-initial position and can be viewed as being tacked on to the more important information. <br>v. When the main clause describes a condition versus an action, non-deictic expressions are not used with \u306b because they are viewed as adverbs qualifying the nature of said state of being.<br><br>There are, in fact, two more conditions that hinder the appearance of \u306b with inherently non-deictic expressions.<br><br>vi. Adverbs of non-deictic nature that cannot be used as nouns are not marked with \u306b &#8211; ex. \u4e00\u663c\u591c (all day and night). <br>vii. Whenever a non-deictic noun is used outside of a literal temporal sense and\/or serves another grammatical function as a regular standalone noun\u2014e.g. \u8a18\u61b6\u306e\u59cb\u307e\u308a (beginning of one&#8217;s memory) vs. \u306f\u3058\u307e\u308a\u306b\u306f (in the beginning).<br><br>The latter point, vii., also begs the question of other grammatical functions that \u306b may have which necessitate its presence with said non-deictic nouns.<br><br>i. \u59cb\u307e\u308a\u306b\u306f\u5fc5\u305a\u7d42\u308f\u308a\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002(Spatial \u306b) <br>There must always be an end to a beginning. <br><br>ii. \u4f1a\u8b70\u306f\u3044\u3064\u306b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\u3002<br>When should we have our meeting?<br><br><strong>Particle Note<\/strong>: Though not reflected well in the English translation, \u306b is not after \u3044\u3064 to mark time; rather, it is there to mark it as the object of what is being decided.<br><br>This provides a great opportunity to make it clear that when we talk about when to use the temporal \u306b or not, we are referring to when these same words would be used with &#8220;in\/on\/at&#8221; in English. This does not mean that these words cannot be used with other particles. Meaning, if you wish to say, &#8220;from&#8230;,&#8221; or &#8220;until&#8230;,&#8221; or say even &#8220;&#8230; is a&#8230;,&#8221; expect the appropriate particle to follow instead of \u306b.<br><br>iii. \u671d\u304b\u3089\u6669\u307e\u3067\u53cb\u9054\u3068\u904a\u3073\u307e\u304f\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>I had a blast with my friends from morning till evening.<br><br>It is also important to note that the \u306b in \uff5e\u307e\u3067\u306b (by), a compound particle used to indicate a deadline, actually utilizes the temporal \u306b, meaning that its grammar follows what we have learned so far. <br><br>iv. \u671d9\u6642\u307e\u3067\u306b\u6e08\u307e\u305b\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3057\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u306d\u3002<br>Please make sure to get it finished by 9 AM.<br><br>Although we have already delved into so much of the grammar surrounding non-deictic expressions, there is still more for us to explore. That being said, in this lesson, we will also look into some of the ways you can expand your vocabulary in this area with much needed affixes (prefixes and suffixes).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Core Vocabulary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this section, we will look over examples of vague, context-dependent expressions which constitute as core vocabulary words. Many of these words will already be familiar to you from past example sentences in lessons up to this point, but we will also take the time to iron out any lingering grammar questions.<br><br>\u25bcTime of Day<br><br>Non-deictic expressions which vaguely refer to time periods which occur during the day can all be characterized as typically taking \u306b in isolation, more so than not<sup data-fn=\"6cbcf149-7fa9-4d89-924a-e60292c1651a\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#6cbcf149-7fa9-4d89-924a-e60292c1651a\" id=\"6cbcf149-7fa9-4d89-924a-e60292c1651a-link\">1<\/a><\/sup>.

Unequivocally, if \uff5e\u660e\u3051 is used as a suffix, it always indicates the period directly after the time frame it is attached to. If, however, it comes before the time frame, like in \u660e\u3051\u306e\u5e74 (the following year), the translation as well as how Japanese speakers internalize this is simply a simplification of introducing the next said unit of time right after the last one ended without having to repeat said time frame.
