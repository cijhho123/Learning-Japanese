Although you should already be well-versed with the differences between plain speech and polite speech, there is far more to showing respect to others than just using \u3067\u3059 and \uff5e\u307e\u3059.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To begin our formal coverage of \u656c\u8a9e, we will be covering a range of things known collectively as \u656c\u79f0, a term which translates as &#8220;title of honor&#8221; or more practically as &#8220;polite form of address.&#8221;&nbsp;From what has been taught thus far, you are actually already familiar with the most basic examples&nbsp;such as \uff5e\u3055\u3093, \uff5e\u69d8, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Curriculum Note<\/strong>: This lesson is currently under revision. Please forgive the mess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are \u656c\u79f0?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Often times, \u656c\u79f0 are compared to the&nbsp;suffixes &#8220;Mr.&#8221; and &#8220;Mrs.&#8221; in English, but the versality, social implications, as well as the grammatical restrictions \u656c\u79f0 may have are far more complicated than the gender or marital status of a person.&nbsp;Rather, \u547c\u79f0 are chosen based on the degree and nature of respect, or lack thereof, towards a given individual.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Japanese, \u656c\u79f0 refers to either a prefix\/suffix that shows respect to the listener or third-person,&nbsp;standalone words which serve the same function of giving respect to the listener but as pronouns in their own right.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various applications \u656c\u79f0 may have. Many are used in daily conversation, but then there are also those specialized for the written language.&nbsp;As such, it will take some time to integrate all of them into your speech.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make things easier, this lesson will&nbsp;only focus on the \u656c\u79f0 that function as suffixes, but before investigating them on a case-by-case basis, we will go over a few ground rules for how they are generally used.&nbsp;Note that aside from these rules, each suffix will have a number of general implications that may not always hold true in every situation. This is because \u656c\u79f0&nbsp;are tied to personae, and how people are perceived is based on the eye of the beholder.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rule 1: Thou shalt only use one \u656c\u79f0&nbsp;with a single name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rule 2: Thou shalt only use \u656c\u79f0&nbsp;to address others and not thyself.&nbsp;<br>Rule 3: Thou shalt not use \u656c\u79f0 when referring to others in one&#8217;s in-group.<br>Rule 4: It is permissible to omit \u656c\u79f0 in writing when (multiple) people are being mentioned so long as a disclaimer (\u656c\u79f0\u7565) is attached.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As hinted at, there are situations in which these rules&nbsp;governing \u656c\u79f0 are broken, but that doesn&#8217;t lessen the significance that they have.&nbsp;To demonstrate how these rules typically function, consider the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1a. \u5e97\u54e1\u3055\u3093\u306f\u88d5\u5b50\u3055\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3088\u3002X<br>1b.\u5e97\u54e1\u306e\u65b9\u306f\u3001\u88d5\u5b50\u3055\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3088\u3002\u3007<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1c. \u5e97\u54e1\u3055\u3093\u306e\u540d\u524d\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u88d5\u5b50\u3068\u8a00\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3088\u3002\u3007<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shopkeeper&#8217;s name is Yuko.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2a. \u79c1\u306f\u91d1\u5b50\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3007<br>2b. \u79c1\u306f\u91d1\u5b50\u3055\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3002X<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2c. \u91d1\u5b50\u3055\u3093\u306f\u79c1\u3067\u3059\u3002X<br>2d. \u91d1\u5b50\u306f\u79c1\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3007<br>I am Kaneko.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even considering different grammatical circumstances, these rules are&nbsp;unbroken.

This is both out of respect for the addressee&#8217;s culture and a perceived understanding of how foreigners wish to be addressed on far more familial terms. One could say this has&nbsp;been popularized&nbsp;in large part by&nbsp;ubiquitous scenes such as &#8220;\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3068\u547c\u3093\u3067\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. \u30bb\u30b9\u3055\u3093\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u306b\u6765\u3066\u4f55\u5e74\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>How many years has it been&nbsp;since you came to&nbsp;Japan, Seth-san?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When such form of address is had towards a fellow Japanese speaker, the intent is usually one of breaking the ice. There are various reasons for why a speaker may wish to place some distance between those who would simply be viewed as friends in a Western mindset, and so one ought not be quick to judge why someone has yet to resort to \u547c\u3073\u6368\u3066 as that should be signaled by the other party out of courtesy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, using a person&#8217;s full name, if known, will always be politer than dropping a person&#8217;s lower name in favor of just using their surname.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When \uff5e\u3055\u3093 is seen after personal nouns, the choice between it and the more formal \uff5e\u69d8 (see below) is a matter of familiarity with \uff5e\u3055\u3093 being lighter and more affectionate in tone in most cases.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. \u7686\u3055\u3093\u3001\u6c17\u3092\u3064\u3051\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002<br>Everyone, please be careful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9. \u304a\u5b50\u3055\u3093\u306b\u559c\u3070\u308c\u308b\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure your child will enjoy it.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10. \u304a\u96a3\u3055\u3093\u305f\u3061\u306b\u76f8\u8ac7\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002Let&#8217;s discuss it with the neighbors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: The suffix \uff5e\u305f\u3061 is capable of being modified by the plural ending&nbsp;\uff5e\u9054 to indicate a group while maintaining a polite register.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11. \u304a\u6bcd\u3055\u3093\u3001\u8272\u9055\u3044\u306e\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u6355\u307e\u3048\u305f\u305e\uff01<br>Mom, I caught a shiny Pokemon!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this same vein of showing familiarity while portraying a polite tone, it is also possible to see \uff5e\u3055\u3093 affectionately used after non-human entities.
