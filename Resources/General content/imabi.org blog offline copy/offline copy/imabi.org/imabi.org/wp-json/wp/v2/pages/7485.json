While this is true from an etymological standpoint, the precise functions which \uff5e\u306e\u3060 possesses as well as its relationship to \u306e\u3067 and \u304b\u3089 are incredibly complex and intricate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is \uff5e\u306e\u3060?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From a literal breakdown, \uff5e\u306e\u3060 is the combination of the nominalizing function of the particle \u306e and the copula \u3060. Unlike other utilizations of the nominalizer \u306e (\u6e96\u4f53\u52a9\u8a5e) , however, \uff5e\u306e\u3060 does not allow for \u304c\u30fb\u306e interchangeability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u30c6\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u541b\uff5b\u304c\u30fb\u306e\uff5d\u5230\u7740\u3057\u305f<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306e<\/span>\u3092\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3002&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Do you know that Taylor-kun has arrived?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u30c6\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u541b\uff5b\u304c \u3007\u30fb\u306e X\uff5d\u5230\u7740\u3057\u305f<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306e\u3060<\/span>\u3002<br>a.

The purpose \uff5e\u306e\u3060 has in both instances here is <em>defining the scope of the statement being made<\/em>. This is how \uff5e\u306e\u3060 is associated with providing explanation and behaves the most like a noun: [\uff5e\u306e] is what is or is not true.<br><br>In Exs. 4-6, \uff5e\u306e\u3060 indicates various<em> moods which are interpreted by various factors<\/em> such as whether the statement is directed at a situation or a person. While etymologically tied to the notion of &#8220;explaining,&#8221; the application of that notion is stretched to its limit. We can also see how \uff5e\u306e\u3060 has all the variation endowed to it by its individual parts\u2014\u306e contracting to \u3093 and the copula utilizing its own different forms based on politeness, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This lesson will combat \uff5e\u306e\u3060 by first going into great detail on how it functions as a scope marker. Before delving, however, a few things must be made abundantly clear. For our first lesson on \uff5e\u306e\u3060, we will principally be looking at it in declarative positive sentences in sentence-final position.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, variations based on politeness, formality, and tone will appear in their respective capacities<sup data-fn=\"aea955fe-ada7-4d77-a9e5-4b7acabc2fc7\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#aea955fe-ada7-4d77-a9e5-4b7acabc2fc7\" id=\"aea955fe-ada7-4d77-a9e5-4b7acabc2fc7-link\">1<\/a><\/sup>. Meaning, whether it shows up as \uff5e\u3093\u3060, \uff5e\u306e\u3067\u3059, \uff5e\u3093\u3067\u3059, \uff5e\u306e\u3067\u3042\u308b, \uff5e\u306e, \uff5e\u306e\u3058\u3083, what have you, they are all one of the same. As such, the grammar point at hand will be uniformly be referred to as \uff5e\u306e\u3060.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, \uff5e\u306e\u3060 itself follows all predicate types to take over that very role of predicate for whatever nuance effect the speaker is trying to make. Of course, what it means is the primary focus of this lesson, but we must not forget the basics of conjugation: that being how \uff5e\u306e\u3060 attaches itself.<br><br>\uff5e\u306e\u3060 attaches to the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 of conjugational parts of speech.

For instance, consider the following sentences in English.<br><br>[scope of negation]<br>i. Seth-sensei did not drink beer, but he did drink soju. <br><br>In this example, the range of [not], the negation element, extends to [drink beer] but not to [drink soju]. <br><br>Japanese does not always utilize the same protocols as English against structural ambiguity caused by mishandled scope. In place of parallelism or punctuation to indicate a predictable range=scope, the scope of any given word is determined by relationships perceived to be obvious via context (previously disclosed information) and\/or structural limitations. <br><br>Consider the following sentence and try to define the scope of negation.<br><br>7a. \u50d5\u306f\u60b2\u3057\u3044\u304b\u3089\u6ce3\u3044\u305f\u306e\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3088\u3002<br>It&#8217;s not the case I cried because I was sad.<br><br>Because of the nominalizing effect of \u306e itself, the negation marker \uff5e\u306a\u3044 denies the premise of [\u60b2\u3057\u3044\u304b\u3089\u6ce3\u3044\u305f], which means that the speaker <em>did<\/em> still cry. As both a structural limitation and as a general given, the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">scope of negation pertains to what immediately comes before the negation marker<\/span>. For every scope, though, there is a part of it called the focus which helps provide context to said scope. In this scenario, [\u60b2\u3057\u3044\u304b\u3089] is the focus (greyed in the examples that follow), as it puts the scope of negation into perspective. <br> <br>Next, let&#8217;s consider the following paraphrasing of Ex. 7a and what its sentence structure implies about scope and the nominalization effect of \uff5e\u306e\u3060.\u3000<br><br>7b. \u50d5\u304c\u6ce3\u3044\u305f\u306e\u306f<mark style=\"background-color:#e1dfdc\" class=\"has-inline-color\">\u60b2\u3057\u3044\u304b\u3089<\/mark>\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3088\u3002<br> My having cried is not because I&#8217;m sad.<br><br>This is what is known as a cleft sentence (\u5206\u88c2\u6587). A cleft sentence is a complex sentence that could have been stated by a simple sentence, but the speaker chooses to elevate a certain section for some emphatic purpose. In 7b., we can see how [\u6ce3\u3044\u305f] is elevated to the topic of the sentence and how \u306e remains crucial for it being nominalized just as it was in 7a. The scope of negation has not changed, but the scope of \uff5e\u306e\u3060, which defines <em>what is what<\/em>, does appear to truly derive from the nominalizer \u306e. Just from [\u50d5\u304c\u6ce3\u3044\u305f\u306e\u306f], it is understood that the reasoning for why is to follow. Likewise, with [\u60b2\u3057\u3044\u304b\u3089\u6ce3\u3044\u305f\u306e], we know that either that is indeed what is up, or it is precisely not what is up. hinging on whether the copula is positive or negative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defining that the scope of \uff5e\u306e\u3060 is &#8220;what is what&#8221; does enable it to define the statement as being significant in the grander scheme of things. However, this does come with its own number of limitations, specifically what can go inside said scope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when dealing with emotional phenomena (like the crying in Ex. 8), \uff5e\u306e\u3060 portrays the scopes it defines as being objective truths not affected and\/or dependent on the speaker&#8217;s subjective thoughts of external factors\/information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8.

Likewise, rain falling from the sky is not contingent on people using umbrellas, nor is it raining the be-all and end-all reason for why people use umbrellas.

The question is more so why the book is there, with the most logical scope being chosen as the premise to ask for clarity. The responder knows the objective truth of the situation that occurred. If the plain negative were to be used (14b.), the impression would be that no action occurred\u2014neither buying nor borrowing. Therefore, the speaker responds by defining the &#8220;it&#8221; of the matter. Now, the English translation does not use its own &#8220;it is that&#8230;&#8221; structure, which is most parallel to \uff5e\u306e\u3060, because of how natural English works. In Japanese, we see that \uff5e\u306e\u3060, in so far, is crucial in stating things for what they are provided there is an &#8220;it&#8221; established.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at another example but with the only context difference being the presence or lack of \uff5e\u306e\u3060.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>15a. \u8a66\u5408\u306b\u8ca0\u3051\u305f\u9078\u624b\u305f\u3061\u306f\u6ce3\u3044\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>The athletes who lost the match are not crying. <br><br>15b. \u8a66\u5408\u306b\u8ca0\u3051\u305f\u9078\u624b\u305f\u3061\u306f<mark style=\"background-color:#e1dfdc\" class=\"has-inline-color\">\u6ce3\u3044<\/mark>\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>As for the athletes who lost the match, it&#8217;s not that they&#8217;re crying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ex. 15a. is a simple negation that the athletes are crying. Whereas in Ex. 15b, the nature of what is going on is being put into question. Given the context, the crying itself may or may not be what is being negated based on what the speaker has an issue with that description. They could be upset that the athletes&#8217; tears are being portrayed as whining as opposed to a natural response, their faces could be covered in sweat and just looks like they are crying, they may even not be crying at all (but something serious is still occurring). Whatever the case may be, it would be incorrect to say that Ex. 15a. and Ex. 15b. are synonymous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, we have only seen the focus of \uff5e\u306e\u3060 as being either in the affirmative or the negative, the focus of \uff5e\u306e\u3060 can be just as varied as predicates can be themselves.

In this scenario, we find that \uff5e\u306e\u3060 becomes unnatural due to redundancy without further explication, as the nouns themselves function as the focus, and already being nouns means that they do not need \uff5e\u306e\u3060 to intervene to nominalize them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>20a. \u30bb\u30b9\u3055\u3093\u306f\u5b66\u751f\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\u5148\u751f\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>20b. \u30bb\u30b9\u3055\u3093\u306f\u5b66\u751f\u306a\u306e\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\u5148\u751f\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3002??<br>20a.

Meanwhile, in Ex. 36, there are just as many places to be born as there are people who are alive, so we see that even the questioner naturally inserts \uff5e\u306e\uff1f (interrogative form) to even pose the question as to whether Ryo-kun&#8217;s birth took place in Tokyo. His response in Ex. 36a is unnatural for similar reasons as to why Ex 34a&#8217;s response was unnatural. Firstly, he is not answering the question, and while stating that Tokyo is not his birthplace is a logical response, the lack of \uff5e\u306e\u3060 causes his reply to sound disjunct. It would only leave the questioner with more questions than an answer. Secondly, it sounds as though [\u6771\u4eac\u3067\u306f] is within the scope of the predicate, and with it also being negated, was he even born? If that sounds preposterous, then you are getting closer to understanding when and how \uff5e\u306e\u3060 becomes necessary. <br><br>Context still remains key to how everything comes together in a sentence. With that being said, there are contexts (and lack thereof) which would affect \uff5e\u306e\u3060&#8217;s necessity with the predicate \u751f\u307e\u308c\u308b at the center of discussion for Exs. 35-36. <br><br>37a. \u50d5\u306f\u75c5\u9662\u3067\u751f\u307e\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\u25b3<br>Intended: I was not born in a hospital. <br><br>With [\u75c5\u9662\u3067] sounding as it is a part=within the scope of the predicate, a focus particle like \u306f\u30fb\u3082 ought to be placed to indicate that this complement is within just the scope of the negative element \uff5e\u306a\u3044 and not &#8220;[\u75c5\u9662\u3067] and the act of being born&#8221; being combined. Even then, \uff5e\u306e\u3060 would likely still appear to define the scope clearly as &#8220;being born and where at.&#8221; <br><br>37b. \u50d5\u306f\u75c5\u9662\u3067\u306f\u751f\u307e\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002(?)<br>Intended: I <em>wasn&#8217;t born in a hospital<\/em>. <br><br>Without context, we expect that this is the speaker explaining their backstory from the very beginning, as the focus marker \u306f, while doing its part in highlighting [\u75c5\u9662\u3067] as a point of contrast, also provides contrast for [\u75c5\u9662\u3067\u751f\u307e\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f] with a &#8220;normal&#8221; scenario. This would usually trigger the use of \uff5e\u306e\u3060. Sure enough, in the full context (37c), we see that the defining of [\u75c5\u9662\u3067\u306f\u751f\u307e\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f] is manifested with \uff5e\u306e, indicating that was not entirely absent after all, albeit not within the same sentence. <br><br>37c. \u50d5\u306f\u75c5\u9662\u3067\u306f\u751f\u307e\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\u7523\u58f0\u3092\u4e0a\u3052\u305f\u306e\u306f\u3001\u3069\u3053\u304b\u306e\u7a7a\u304d\u5bb6\u3060\u3063\u305f\u304b\u306a\u3002<br>I was not born in a hospital. I suppose where I uttered my first cries was an empty house somewhere.<br><br>The presence of \uff5e\u306e\u3060 in the first sentence would hinge on its use as a mood marker, in which case, the listener would anticipate a major implication as to what befell the speaker for not having been born <em>in a hospital<\/em>, or better yet, why the matter is even being brought up. If the claim were being challenged, that would be well within the realm of \uff5e\u306e\u3060, but then the level of uncertainty felt in the second sentence would be unnatural. As such, [\u50d5\u306f\u75c5\u9662\u3067\u306f\u751f\u307e\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f] in context is merely a statement of fact not pertaining to the notion of multiple-choice scenarios, but the speaker does still then switch over to providing that context anyway as part of defining the scenario at hand. <br><br>Let&#8217;s also consider a context in which [\u6771\u4eac\u3067\u751f\u307e\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f] and the &#8220;multiple-choice&#8221; dynamic between it and simply &#8220;not being a Tokyoite&#8221; having an effect be only natural to surmise, thus allowing also for \uff5e\u306e\u3060 not to be present.<br><br>38. \u8ad2\u541b\u306f\u6771\u4eac\u3067\u751f\u307e\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u304b\u3089\u3001\u5171\u901a\u8a9e\u3092\u7fd2\u5f97\u3059\u308b\u306b\u306f\u6642\u9593\u304c\u304b\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>Because Ryo-kun was not born in Tokyo, it took some time for him to learn Standard Japanese. <br><br>In this context, there is no need to juxtapose [\u6771\u4eac\u3067] with other places. The dynamic is clear: those not born where Standard Japanese is spoken natively (Tokyo) end up having to learn it. The situation itself sufficiently defines its own parameters=scopes (think about both clauses) without the need for \uff5e\u306e\u3060.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What these contexts have shown is that, for the scope marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060 to not be invoked with verbal predicates, the complements pertaining to the establishment of said predicate must be tight-knit, with the connection being apparent to both the speaker and potential listeners. Even so, \uff5e\u306e\u3060 may still need to be present to prevent ambiguity, given how certain modifiers work (think about adverbial modifiers which are extensions of the predicate or on dependent clauses). <br><br>39a. \u308f\u3056\u3068\u3084\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3042\u308c\u3070\u3001\u5225\u306e\u8a71\u3060\u304c\u3001\u308f\u3056\u3068\u3084\u3089\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u304b\u3089\u3001\u5927\u4e08\u592b\u3060\u308d\u3046\u3002X<br>39b. \u308f\u3056\u3068\u3084\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3042\u308c\u3070\u3001\u5225\u306e\u8a71\u3060\u304c\u3001\u308f\u3056\u3068\u3084\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3089\u3001\u5927\u4e08\u592b\u3060\u308d\u3046\u3002\u3007<br>39a.

As such, \uff5e\u306e\u3060 is necessary to bring about this interpretation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For sentences without \uff5e\u306e\u3060, the establishment of the predicate becomes the focus of affirmation or negation itself, and so adding a &#8220;scope marker&#8221; becomes grammatically redundant. <br><br>40. \u8ad2\u541b\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u3060\u3002<br>Ryo-kun is Japanese.<br><br>41. \u5916\u306f\u5bd2\u304f\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>It is not cold outside.<br><br>42. \u30e9\u30d5\u30a1\u30a8\u30eb\u541b\u306f\u304d\u3087\u3046\u306f\u3001\u4ed5\u4e8b\u306b\u884c\u304b\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>Rafael-kun did not go to work today. <br><br>When we do see the scope marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060, that clues us in to there being an element separate from the predicate establishing itself but that which is still involved.

If this relation happens to be intrinsically obvious based on certain criteria, \uff5e\u306e\u3060 may be foregone (Exs. 32-33, 35, 38) , but other sentence dynamics (adverbial modifiers, etc. )can easily disrupt these criteria (Ex. 39). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having seen so many sentences utilizing negation because of how much impact it has on the utility of \uff5e\u306e\u3060, let&#8217;s step back and look at questions in the affirmative and how focus on a particular element (complement) would warrant \uff5e\u306e\u3060.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>43.\uff08\u8868\u9762\u306b\u300eEXPO 2025\u300f\u3068\u3044\u3046\u6587\u5b57\u306e\u66f8\u304b\u308c\u305f\u9945\u982d\u3092\u898b\u3066\uff09<br>a. \u3053\u308c\u3001<mark style=\"background-color:#e1dfdc\" class=\"has-inline-color\">\u5927\u962a\u3067<\/mark>\u8cb7\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f\u25ce<br>b. \u3053\u308c\u3001\u5927\u962a\u3067\u8cb7\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304b\uff1f(?)<br>(Looks at manju with the words &#8220;EXPO 2025&#8221; written on the surface)<br>a.

They&#8217;re dishes.&#8221; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the focus of Ex. 55 could be considered the genre of the book, in which case the negative copula \u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044&#8217;s focus is not negating the preceding noun in its entirety, the focus of Ex. 56 does imply that the focus is the Y in its entirety. Thus, Exs. 54-56 demonstrate that the extent of Y that may be considered the focus varies depending on context, and that that information is gathered by what logical Y are available. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this in mind, we should expect the scope marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060 to inherit this same context-dependent boundary of what constitutes its focus. To examine this, let&#8217;s return back to Ex. 3. <br><br>3. \u30c6\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u541b\u306f\u3001<mark style=\"background-color:#e1dfdc\" class=\"has-inline-color\">\u7d4c\u6e08\u5b66\u90e8\u3092<\/mark>\u5352\u696d\u3057\u305f<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044<\/span>\u3002<mark style=\"background-color:#e1dfdc\" class=\"has-inline-color\">\u82b8\u8853\u5b66\u90e8\u3092<\/mark>\u5352\u696d\u3057\u305f<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306e\u3060<\/span>\u3002<br>It is not the case that Taylor-kun is a graduate of the economics department; he is a graduate of the fine arts department. <br><br>Here, we see that the greyed areas constitute the focus of \uff5e\u306e\u3067\u306a\u3044 and \uff5e\u306e\u3060 respectively, and that in this context, &#8220;graduating itself&#8221; is not part of the focus.

Something did happen, and that is evident from the first \uff5e\u306e\u3060 in the exchange, and at which point, the search for what Y is for the main predicate (\uff5e\u306e\u3060) is on and then answered by the second speaker. <br><br>If we were to search for a difference regarding nuance between scope marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060 statements and nominal predicate ones (think Ex. 56.), it would be that whereas the focus of a nominal predicate, whether it is part or all of Y, is still reflective of basic sentence structure, for \uff5e\u306e\u3060 statements, an active choice is made to attribute its properties to whatever it follows. Ultimately, the basic negative form of \u5207\u3063\u305f is \u5207\u3089\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f, so the choice to say \u5207\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044 has more meaning than just &#8220;&#8216;Y&#8217; didn&#8217;t happen.&#8221; If that <strong>meaning<\/strong> is clear, you have successfully learned about the scope marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060.

Unlike Ex. 69, in which case the greyed elements constitute one focus, sentences can be ambiguous if the mixing of different kinds of potential focuses appear simultaneously. As a severe example of ambiguity, consider the following. Possible focuses are encased in \u3010\u3011.<br><br>70. \u3010\u304d\u306e\u3046\u3011\u3010\u7528\u4e8b\u304c\u3042\u3063\u3066\u3011\u3001\u3010\u8ad2\u541b\u304c\u3011\u3010\u30bb\u30b9\u541b\u306b\u3011\u3010\u96fb\u8a71\u3011\u3057\u305f\u3093\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3002??<br>a. It&#8217;s not that Ryo had stuff to do yesterday and called <em>Seth-kun<\/em>. <br>b. It&#8217;s not that, <em>yesterday<\/em>, Ryo had stuff to do and didn&#8217;t call Seth-kun.<br>c. It&#8217;s not that Ryo-kun <em>having stuff to do<\/em> is why he called Seth-kun.<br>d. It&#8217;s not that <em>Ryo<\/em> had stuff to do and didn&#8217;t call Seth-kun yesterday. <br>e. It&#8217;s not that Ryo had stuff to and <em>called<\/em> Seth-kun yesterday.<br><br>If this sentence were spoken, the <em>prominent<\/em> element would undoubtedly be accompanied with higher intonation, potentially alleviating the intense structural ambiguity of the sentence. Even when written down, however, as undesirable as this is for even Japanese standards, the idea of &#8220;prominence&#8221; can help us determine which of these five interpretations is more likely. The more ancillary a complement feels, the less fathomable that <em>it<\/em> is the focus becomes.<br><br>In Ex. 70, the predicate is \u96fb\u8a71\u3059\u308b, and since the point of calling is to call someone, a is the most likely interpretation based on the notion of prominence and the exclusion of ancillary details from that designation. In turn, the least likely interpretation b, with the second worst being c. Though not unfathomable, d is odd because prominence has it that a is most likely, with e being potentially high if solid external context whatsoever indicates strongly what Ryo did in actuality and why mentioning the wrong action is even pertinent. Though a rather specific threshold, it is more likely than b or c. If Ryo is not the one who called, who did, and who was it, then, who had stuff to do yesterday? Yet, what makes this more likely is the likelihood of external context having already filled in that blank. <br><br>Typically, when there are two or more complements that could be interpreted as the focus, the one with the strongest (most intrinsic) relationship with the predicate wins, as we are beginning to see. <br><br>71. \u3010\u30c6\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u541b\u304c\u3011\u3010\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u732b\u306b\u3011\u990c\u3092\u3042\u3052\u305f\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>a.

(&#8230;Seth did) <br><br>The reason why the strongest relationship equates to prominence is that the way a verb intrinsically works does not change even if the elements of the sentence are switched around due to however the speaker, quite simply, feels. For the verb \u3042\u3052\u308b, its most intrinsic complement is &#8220;to whom&#8221; one is giving. This can be proven in English by how unnatural ii is.<br><br>ii.
