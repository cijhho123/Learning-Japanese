Meaning, if there are two or more options when conjugating for something in polite speech, the longer phrase will always be the politer version. Keep this in mind as we learn the various polite forms of the copula.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Copula Verb&nbsp;\u3067\u3059<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The polite copula verb in Japanese, \u3067\u3059<sup data-fn=\"870954f9-c06d-40ce-8d2f-fa771f0b33e1\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#870954f9-c06d-40ce-8d2f-fa771f0b33e1\" id=\"870954f9-c06d-40ce-8d2f-fa771f0b33e1-link\">1<\/a><\/sup>, also directly translates to the various forms of &#8220;to be&#8221; in English which Japanese grammar does not distinguish: &#8220;to be,&#8221; &#8220;is,&#8221; &#8220;am,&#8221; &#8220;are,&#8221; and &#8220;will be.&#8221; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Basic Sentence Structure w\/ \u3067\u3059<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as with \u3060, the basic sentence structure remains &#8220;X is Y&#8221; in polite speech, which will mostly be limited to noun-predicates in this lesson. In polite speech, this pattern is rendered as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>X\u306fY\u3067\u3059<sup data-fn=\"ef0efbda-b090-4bf2-8b4c-df356cc43e46\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#ef0efbda-b090-4bf2-8b4c-df356cc43e46\" id=\"ef0efbda-b090-4bf2-8b4c-df356cc43e46-link\">2<\/a><\/sup>\u3002<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that X\u3067\u3059Y is NEVER correct. In this pattern, \u3067\u3059 is in its predicative form (\u7d42\u6b62\u5f62), and it must always appear at the end of the sentence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of polite speech, and the reason one would choose \u3067\u3059 over \u3060, is to establish <strong>social distance<\/strong> between the speaker and listener. This helps maintain civility and conveys an overall sense of politeness in the conversation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pronunciation Note<\/strong>: In Standard Japanese, the \/u\/ sound in \u3067\u3059 is typically devoiced.

However, it is often used more broadly to indicate <strong>active listening<\/strong> during a conversation. This cultural practice shows attentiveness and respect to the speaker. If you have watched anime or observed Japanese interactions, you might have noticed listeners frequently saying <strong>\u306f\u3044<\/strong> as the conversation progresses.

Japanese does not have such grammatical subject place holders, but the way Japanese indicates that something exists in a particular situation may still involve the basic copular sentence pattern X\u306fY+{\u3060\u30fb\u3067\u3059}. One way of reconciling this difference is by translating \u306f as &#8220;as for&#8221; so that, at the very least, the placements of X and Y are more or less where they are in English.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>17. \u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u306f2\u4eba\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>There were two Japanese people.<br>Literally: As for Japanese people, there were two people.<br>X = \u65e5\u672c\u4eba; Y = \uff12\u4eba.<br><br>18. \u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u306f1\u4eba\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>There was one Chinese person.<br>Literally: As for Chinese people, there was one person.<br>X = \u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba; Y = \uff11\u4eba.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This logic also helps us with examples like the following in which \u201dX was Y&#8221; is not quite the most natural wording in English but remains grammatical and parallel to the Japanese phrasing. This includes situations with the subject holder &#8220;it&#8221; that we learned about in Lesson 10. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>19. \u5915\u3054\u98ef\u306f\u30ab\u30ec\u30fc\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>There was curry for dinner. <br>Literally: Dinner was curry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>20. \u304d\u306e\u3046\u306f\u96e8\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>It was rainy yesterday.<br>Literally: Yesterday was rain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nuancing of the Past Tense Form<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Japanese, the past tense form does not always indicate an event or state that occurred in the past. In some cases, it may be used simply to convey information rather than a literal past event. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>21. \u3042\u306e\u7537\u306f\u8b66\u5bdf\u5b98\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>That man was a policeman.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>22. \u3042\u306e\u5b50\u306f\u7537\u306e\u5b50\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>That child was a boy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Japanese past tense form also covers the &#8220;past perfect tense.&#8221; In English, the copula &#8220;to be&#8221; takes the form of &#8220;had been&#8221; in this tense. In both languages, this &#8220;past perfect tense,&#8221; also known as the &#8220;pluperfect tense,&#8221; is accompanied with a time phrase to establish that the state in question had been true for a certain period of time in the past. <br><br>23. \u30c6\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u541b<sup data-fn=\"033c50d9-15dd-4397-805e-03f84ff0c812\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#033c50d9-15dd-4397-805e-03f84ff0c812\" id=\"033c50d9-15dd-4397-805e-03f84ff0c812-link\">9<\/a><\/sup>\u306f\u3001\u5f53\u6642\u306f\u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>Taylor-kun had been a student back then.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>24. \u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>This has been the news.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Polite Negative Forms<br>\u5426\u5b9a\u5f62\uff08\u4e01\u5be7\u4f53\uff09<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When creating the negative form (\u5426\u5b9a\u5f62)\u2014&#8221;is not\/are not&#8221;\u2014in polite speech, you have two routes at your disposal.

class=\"wp-block-heading\">Recap<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This lesson highlights that polite speech can be quite complex, as there are multiple forms that vary depending on how polite the speaker wishes to be. To better understand this complexity, here are two important rules of thumb:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>\u3067\u3059 lacks an attributive form (\u9023\u4f53\u5f62):<strong><br><\/strong>This means it cannot be used anywhere except at the end of a sentence.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Politeness markers generally lack an attributive form (\u9023\u4f53\u5f62) in prescriptive Standard Japanese. As a result, politeness is typically marked only at the end of the main clause, rather than in each subordinate clause.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>These rules of thumb simplify sentence construction and help avoid common beginner mistakes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-16018d1d wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-align-center wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/imabi.org\/copular-sentences-i%e3%80%80%e3%82%b3%e3%83%94%e3%83%a5%e3%83%a9%e6%96%87%ef%bc%88%e6%99%ae%e9%80%9a%e4%bd%93%ef%bc%89\/\">Previous Lesson<\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-align-center wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/imabi.org\/the-particle-ga-i%e3%80%80%e6%a0%bc%e5%8a%a9%e8%a9%9e%e3%80%8c%e3%81%8c%e3%80%8d%e2%91%a0\/\">Next Lesson<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-footnotes\"><li id=\"870954f9-c06d-40ce-8d2f-fa771f0b33e1\">\u3060 and \u3067\u3059 are irrefutably etymologically related despite misinformation regarding the issue.
