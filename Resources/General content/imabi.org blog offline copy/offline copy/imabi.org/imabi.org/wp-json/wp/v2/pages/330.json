Although supplementary verb endings like \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u308b may have more than one function permitted the verb&#8217;s semantics allows it, in which case further context clues would specify the correct meaning, \uff5e\u3059\u304e\u308b has its own meaning at play &#8211; indicating excessive amount in Ex. 30, excessive frequency in Ex. 31, and in the case of Exs. 32-33, indicating the manner marked by the adverb is too excessive. In the latter cases, it is arguable that this is how \uff5e\u3059\u304e\u308b may in fact still affect adverbs provided there is an intervening predicate to establish a manner&#8217;s context. In all four examples, \uff5e\u3059\u304e\u308b&#8217;s meaning is clear and directly related to its independent verb functionality. <br><br>Let&#8217;s throw in another factor. What if it is clear enough from \uff5e\u3059\u304e\u308b that the action in question is excessive in some way, but when the adverb is taken out of the sentence, does the sentence still stand? For Exs. 34-35, the answer is: yes. Drop that adverb, and the excessive nature of the action is still understood.
