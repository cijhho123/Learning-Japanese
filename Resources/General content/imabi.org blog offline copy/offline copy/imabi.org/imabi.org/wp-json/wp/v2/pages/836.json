This makes the anthem of Japan the oldest national anthem in the world. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first mention of the \u541b\u304c\u4ee3 is believed to be from the \u53e4\u4eca\u548c\u6b4c\u96c6 from the 10th century. In this original version, the lyrics are identical except for the first phrase, \u541b\u304c\u4ee3, which instead appears as \u6211\u304c\u541b. In this time period, \u6211\u304c\u541b was used to refer to people receiving praise, and as such, the poem was originally associated with wishing whoever is sung it to have a long life. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The word \u541b, despite its modern use of predominantly referring to male speakers in colloquial speech, has historically been used to indicate the Emperor of Japan or one&#8217;s lord. Even earlier, however, emperors were referred to as \u5927\u541b, while \u541b could also imply endearment to high figures with whom one had romantic relationships with, as seen in Poem 78 of the Man&#8217;y\u014dsh\u016b (\u4e07\u8449\u96c6) composed in the prior Nara Period by the female emperor Genmei (\u5143\u660e\u5929\u7687).<br><br>\u98db\u3076\u9ce5\u306e\u660e\u65e5\u9999\u306e\u91cc\u3092\u7f6e\u304d\u3066\u53bb\u306a\u3070\u541b\u304c\u3042\u305f\u308a\u306f\u898b\u3048\u305a\u304b\u3082\u3042\u3089\u3080<br>If I were to depart and leave behind Asuka, would I no longer be able to see where you live from there? <br><br>The meaning of \u541b being ambiguous as to who exactly it may refer to has been the center of major controversy in the utilization of the poem \u541b\u304c\u4ee3 throughout the centuries. However, since 1999 with the passing of the Act on National Flag and Anthem (\u56fd\u65d7\u53ca\u3073\u56fd\u6b4c\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u6cd5\u5f8b), it has been the official position of the Japanese government to interpret \u541b as the Emperor<sup data-fn=\"f9027e6b-5239-484d-b442-423dff3d7b6d\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#f9027e6b-5239-484d-b442-423dff3d7b6d\" id=\"f9027e6b-5239-484d-b442-423dff3d7b6d-link\">1<\/a><\/sup>, which is reflected in its English translation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lyrics to the \u541b\u304c\u4ee3<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The anthem happens to be the shortest in the world, comprised of a mere 32 characters.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td>\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e<\/td><td>Direct Translation<\/td><td>Poetic Translation<sup data-fn=\"ecb57441-827b-439d-8f02-a59c6a6fb142\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#ecb57441-827b-439d-8f02-a59c6a6fb142\" id=\"ecb57441-827b-439d-8f02-a59c6a6fb142-link\">2<\/a><\/sup><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u541b\u304c\u4ee3<sup data-fn=\"1f485f41-f871-487a-adf8-2637b9ce5ff3\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#1f485f41-f871-487a-adf8-2637b9ce5ff3\" id=\"1f485f41-f871-487a-adf8-2637b9ce5ff3-link\">3<\/a><\/sup>\u306f<br>\u5343\u4ee3\u306b\u516b\u4ee3\u306b<br>\u3055\u3056\u308c\u77f3\u306e<br>\u5dcc\u3068\u306a\u308a\u3066<br>\u82d4\u306e\u751f\u3059\u307e\u3067<\/td><td>May your reign<br>Continue for a thousand, eight thousand generations,<br>Until the pebbles<br>Grow into boulders<br>Lush with moss<\/td><td><em>Thousands of years of happy reign be thine;<\/em><br><em>Rule on, my lord, till what are pebbles now<\/em><br><em>By age united to mighty rocks shall grow<\/em><br><em>Whose venerable sides the moss doth line.<\/em><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Putting aside the meaning of \u541b, which remains the greatest point of contingency in the poem, the grammatical differences should be readily recognizable. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The case particle \u306e is seen used in the same way the case particle \u304c is used in Modern Japanese, which is to mark the subject.
