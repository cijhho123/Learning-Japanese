Due to both isolation, geopolitical factors, and the association of native words onto Kanji, most Kanji have several readings and meanings (or nuancing) associated with them. <br><br>While Kanji readings can be categorized as either being an ON reading (\u97f3\u8aad\u307f) or a KUN reading (\u8a13\u8aad\u307f), the confusion does not end there. The purpose of this lesson is to delve deeper into this ON\/KUN (\u97f3\u8a13) puzzle, so that you may discover ways to help identify the readings of new words you encounter more efficiently. <br><br>\u203bIPA notation is implemented in this lesson. <br><br><strong>Orthography Note<\/strong>: All ON readings will be shown in \u30ab\u30bf\u30ab\u30ca and all KUN readings will be shown in \u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kanji &amp; Meaning<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kanji are known as logograms because of how each character represents a morpheme (unit of meaning). Although it is true that many Kanji are ideographic in origin, it is more efficient to recognize each Kanji as being associated with words which have sound. This meaning-sound correspondence is crucial, as most Kanji possess components (radicals) for either purpose. <br><br>In other words, the shape of a Kanji alone is not indicative of its meaning or sound.<br>For example, the Kanji \u6c34 meaning &#8220;water&#8221; did derive from a pictogram, but how it appears today is not intuitively indicative of this meaning. First, a Mandarin Chinese speaker must recognize this as meaning &#8220;water,&#8221; and since their word for water is &#8220;shu\u01d0,&#8221; that then constitutes the Kanji&#8217;s sound. <br><br>In Japanese, \u6c34 maintained its meaning of &#8220;water&#8221; as well as its Chinese sound in the form of the ON reading \u30b9\u30a4, while the Japanese word for &#8220;water&#8221; became attributed to it as its KUN reading \u307f\u305a.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u97f3\u8aad\u307f<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The history of ON readings is complicated, as they were assimilated into Japanese over multiple waves spanning several centuries from multiple varieties and stages of Chinese, with no particular wave ever completely supplanting previous waves. This has produced four types of ON readings: Wu, Han, Tang, and Conventional ON readings. <br><br>As Japanese has undergone many sound changes over the centuries too, all ON readings are portrayed with their Modern Japanese pronunciations. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Sounds of Wu\u3000\u5449\u97f3<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first wave of readings are called \u5449\u97f3<sup data-fn=\"1d0572ef-0836-46dc-9130-4776c47285a9\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#1d0572ef-0836-46dc-9130-4776c47285a9\" id=\"1d0572ef-0836-46dc-9130-4776c47285a9-link\">1<\/a><\/sup>.

These sound were then further simplified to fit Japanese phonology. Below are the initial consonants (\u58f0\u6bcd) for four Kanji shown above as they progressed from \u5449\u97f3 &gt; \u6f22\u97f3 &gt; how those \u6f22\u97f3 became realized in Japanese. <br>\u99ac: [m] &gt; [mb] &gt; [b]<br>\u6ce5: [n] &gt; [nd] &gt; [d]<br>\u5fae: [\u0271] &gt; [\u0271v] &gt; [b]<br>\u65e5: [\u0235] &gt; [\u0235\u0291] &gt; [\u0291] <br>\u2461\u5449\u97f3 whose initial consonant was a voiced sound became unvoiced, minus nasal consonant initials whose final consonant was [\u014b] in Chinese. As Japanese does not allow mora-final [\u014b], it would be realized as a nasalized high vowel, either \/i\/ or \/u\/.<br>\u6df7: [g] &gt; [k]<br>\u76db: [\u0291] &gt; [s]<br>\u5b9a: [\u0291] &gt; [t]<br>\u2462\u5449\u97f3 whose initial consonant were interpreted as [w] upon entering Japanese changed to [kw]. Few such \u6f22\u97f3 have made it into Modern Japanese, but for those that do, [kw] has since turned into [k]. <br>\u4f1a: [w] &gt; [kwa]  &gt; [k]<br>The \u5449\u97f3 spelling \u30a8 is the modern kana rendition. Traditionally, it is \u30f1, showing the retention of [w] at the time. Up until early Modern Japanese, the \u6f22\u97f3 \u30ab\u30a4 was, in fact, \u30af\u30ef\u30a4.<br><br>The propagation of \u6f22\u97f3 was largely successful, but it did not supplant \u5449\u97f3 entirely. If anything, new meanings of old words were borne from this wave of Chinese influence (see below). It is also often the case that, in general use, different ON readings produce different meanings. This can often be traced back to how individual Kanji in Chinese proper have also been attributed to more than one meaning (morpheme). <br><br>For example, \u884c has the \u5449\u97f3 \u30ae\u30e7\u30a6 and the \u6f22\u97f3 \u30b3\u30a6. \u30ae\u30e7\u30a6 is associated with the meaning of &#8220;to act,&#8221; whereas the meaning of &#8220;to go&#8221; is associated with \u30b3\u30a6. Words made after the propagation of \u6f22\u97f3 may still utilize \u30b3\u30a6 for the sense of &#8220;to act,&#8221; but this is a general dichotomy that can explain why \u30ae\u30e7\u30a6 still appears. <br><br>In Buddhism, \u6f22\u97f3 did not successfully replace \u5449\u97f3. For most sects, \u5449\u97f3 remain the preferred readings for Kanji. This is not without exception, however.

Japanese phonology has never accepted final consonants, and so vowel insertion (\u6bcd\u97f3\u633f\u5165) has always occurred. In the case that said final consonant was [p], it was rendered as \u30d5 in Japanese. <br><br>Many sound changes have since affected the pronunciation of \u30d5, most notably, a sound change known as \u30cf\u884c\u8ee2\u547c in which word-medial and word-final [p] became [w]. A classic example of this is how \u8776 (butterfly) would have initially been pronounced as [tepu], but as a result of this sound change, it changed to [teu] before ultimately becoming [t\u0255o:]. <br><br>In medial position, some Kanji whose ON reading ended in the final consonant [p], in combination with a following mora which contained a stop\/fricative consonant, resulted in \u4fc3\u97f3\u5316 (gemination) of the consonant of the second element. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Word<\/td><td>Reading<\/td><td>Meaning<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u5408\u6226<\/td><td>\u30ab\u30c3\u30bb\u30f3<\/td><td>Battle<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u6cd5\u5ea6<\/td><td>\u30cf\u30c3\u30c8<\/td><td>Taboo\/ordinance (middle ages)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u5165\u58f0<\/td><td>\u30cb\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30a6<\/td><td>Syllable ending in [p], [t], [k] in Middle Chinese<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Though this sound change is not reflected in most modern words using the same ON readings, there has been an overwhelmingly propensity for the final \u30d5 to realize as \u30c4, an attempt at being more conservative to the original Chinese pronunciation.

It has two meanings: &#8220;to be tired&#8221; and &#8220;to stop.&#8221; For the first meaning, its ON reading is \u30d2, and for the second meaning, its ON reading ought to be \u30cf\u30a4. However, the latter reading no longer exists in spoken Japanese and is entirely replaced with \u30d2 &#8211; ex. \u7f77\u514d\uff08\u3072\u3081\u3093\uff09&#8221;dismissal.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Unclassified Readings \u2192 \u6163\u7528\u97f3<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another strange subset of \u6163\u7528\u97f3 are those classified as such for no other reason than their etymology being obscure, despite being still obviously derived from a form of Chinese. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, \u8336 meaning &#8220;tea&#8221; has the ON readings \u30c0 (\u5449\u97f3), \u30bf (\u6f22\u97f3), and \u30b5 (\u5510\u97f3), yet its predominant reading is \u30c1\u30e3. Though written off as a \u6163\u7528\u97f3, the fact that \u30c1\u30e3 more closely aligns with how the Kanji is pronounced in multiple modern Chinese vernaculars makes it clear that \u30c1\u30e3 did not spontaneous arise in Japan.<br><br>Another odd example is the reading \u30dd\u30f3 for \u692a (tangerine).
