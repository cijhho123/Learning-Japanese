As for the nature of the statements made, at first glance, the two claims seem very similar. Both sentences pertain to people, and both sentences pertain to people being alive. Yet, in both languages, there is a peculiar difference as to the perceived perception of truth behind the two statements, with the presence of \u3060 cluing us in to a state of mind different than just saying &#8220;X is Y.&#8221;<sup data-fn=\"b7e8f210-0c25-4539-81ec-11e79a7c455b\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#b7e8f210-0c25-4539-81ec-11e79a7c455b\" id=\"b7e8f210-0c25-4539-81ec-11e79a7c455b-link\">5<\/a><\/sup><br><br>This discrepancy touches on the notion of modality, which is the way in which a language expresses various relationships pertaining to reality and\/or what is perceived as the truth. In other words, the choice to go ahead and use \u3060 to assert a statement is, arguably, a statement in and of itself. This &#8220;assertive&#8221; flare can then be described as its modality. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;Surface Structure&#8221; vs &#8220;Deep Structure&#8221;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While this lesson is about when it is possible to ellipse \u3060, in answering that case, figuring out how \u3060 works overall, and in light of modality, is quintessential. <br><br>The affirmative nature of \u3060 is undeniable, as a declarative sentence by definition is a statement of fact. Even so, other aspects of Japanese grammar such as &#8220;\u304c vs \u306f&#8221; greatly impact why and how basic statements are made and perceived. <br><br>That being said, to begin let&#8217;s take one more step back and disambiguate &#8220;surface structures&#8221; from &#8220;deep structures.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The &#8220;surface structure&#8221; of a sentence is the way it is actually spoken and\/or written, while the &#8220;deep structure&#8221; of a sentence represents its underlying syntactic structure prior to any transformative operations (devices) are implemented which then affect how the &#8220;surface structure&#8221; manifests and is then ultimately interpreted by speakers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Native speakers are such natural experts at the pragmatic interpretation of the final product (surface structures) that the existence of the innerworkings behind it become a blur or even bizarre at times. As an example of how different &#8220;deep structures&#8221; and &#8220;surface structures&#8221; are with basic English, consider the following:<br><br>a. Do you not speak Japanese? (surface structure)<br>b. You no speak Japanese? (deep structure)<br><br>Through a transformative process called &#8220;do-raising&#8221; inserts the auxiliary verb &#8220;do&#8221; to carry tense and agreement features. So, if say past tense were added to the sentence on top of the interrogative function placed on &#8220;do,&#8221; we would get &#8220;did you not speak Japanese?&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;you no spoke Japanese?&#8221; <br><br>So, how does this all tie to the use of \u3060? Its presence in nominal predicates tells us that at a basic understanding of declarative sentences in Japanese, its roll as &#8220;to be&#8221; ought to be accounted for in the basic sentence structure for said sentence type. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td>Deep Structure<\/td><td>Possible Surface Structures<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>X\u304cY\u3060<\/td><td>X\u304cY\u3060<br>X\u306fY\u3060<br>X\u306fY<br>X\u304cY<br>Y\u3060<br>Y<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From just one deep structure, we can produce an array of possible surface structures, each possessing its own nuancing based on the individual transformative process(es) undergone. Most importantly, the existence of surface structures without \u3060 does not exclude its presence in the deep structure. <br><br>The next misnomer to get out of the way is the exclusion of \u3060 in the deep structure of non-nominal-predicates in Japanese somehow negating its grammatical necessity overall. Consider the following examples.<br><br>15a. \u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u306f\u7518\u3044\u3060\u304b\uff1fX<br>15b. \u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u306f\u7518\u3044\uff1f\u3007<br>15c. \u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u3063\u3066\u7518\u3044\u306e\uff1f\u25ce<br>Intended: Is &#8220;chocolate&#8221; sweet? <br><br>16a. \u30ea\u30fc\u3055\u3093\u304c\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3092\u5b66\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b\u3060\u304b\uff1fXX<br>16b. \u30ea\u30fc\u3055\u3093\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3092\u5b66\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b\u3093\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f<br>Intended: Is Lee-san learning Japanese? <br><br>Neither adjectival nor verbal predicates call for the presence of the copular verb in their deep structures, resulting in the grammaticality judgments of Ex. 15a and Ex, 16a. Worse even, Ex. 16a is given &#8220;XX,&#8221; a degree of bad to which it has no merit due to other transformative processes being ignored. For both examples, the degree to which every aspect of Japanese phraseology combines and produces a natural sentence is equally important &#8211; everything ultimately builds on each other.<br><br>To compare, in English, the copula verb &#8220;to be&#8221; is both present and obligatory with adjectival predicates.<br><br>c. Airi is a cat. (Nominal Predicate)<br>d. Airi is furry. (Adjectival Predicate)<br><br>Given the simplistic nature of both predicate types, and without knowledge of other languages, it would appear as though this might be an example of a &#8220;universal,&#8221; a feature found across all languages. In reality, this is not the case, as many languages throughout the world do not utilize copular elements with adjectival(-like) predicates. <br><br>While it may seem that mentioning this is meant to play the devil&#8217;s advocate, the opposite is true. Just because something is not a universal does not mean that universals are nonexistent. In other words, the use of &#8220;to be&#8221; with adjectives in English has no bearing on how \u3060 is not used with Japanese adjectives or pertinent to how it is used entirely.<br><br>There is also the issue of each modal expression in a language being unique. If modality helps speakers express how they feel toward stating relationships, then it would be suffice to say that no two modal expressions are exactly the same, even those that are etymologically related. If anything, being etymologically related would make it easier to relate the two as such expressions as a starting point for comparison. All this is being mentioned because of how \u3067\u3059, the polite form of \u3060, has independently evolved the ability to mark politeness in adjectival predicates.<br><br>17. \u611b\u8389\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306f\u53ef\u611b\u3044<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u3067\u3059<\/span>\u3002<br>Airi-chan is cute.<br><br>Whereas \u3060 has both a syntactic role of meaning &#8220;to be&#8221; and can denote modality by emphasizing the speaker&#8217;s affirmation about stating the fact at hand, the use of \u3067\u3059 after adjectival predicates in this way is purely for expressing modality &#8211; in this case, the need to express a statement in a polite manner.<br><br>With an objective view of how surface structures and deep structures may differ from each other, we now have bigger and better questions to ask ourselves as we get to the bottom of how to use \u3060, including when to ellipse it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Distribution of \u3060<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To investigate how \u3060 truly works, there are two questions to keep in mind: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>How does ellipsing \u3060 affect the grammaticality of a sentence?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What does the interchangeability or lack thereof \u3060 with \u3067\u3059 tell us about the modality of \u3060?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all the examples from earlier in which \u3060 could be ellipsed, we have only seen this occur in sentence-final position, creating a huge bias as to whether ellipsis is the norm for \u3060 or not.

As we will touch on later as well, while \u3060 is structurally part of these predicates, they can be still inferred as predicates even in its absence.  <br><br>The desire to tone down the assertive tone of a declarative sentence touches on what is meant by &#8221; low modality in terms of affirmation,&#8221; leading to the ellipsis of \u3060 in objective, level-headed grammar patterns which utilize quotative verbs. This allows the speaker to not be overbearing in stating what, hopefully, is factually sound.

As for Environment 5, however, that discussion will be deferred to our <a href=\"https:\/\/imabi.org\/the-scope-marker-%ef%bd%9e%e3%81%ae%e3%81%a0\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"7485\">coverage on \uff5e\u306e\u3060<\/a>, as its innerworkings is highly complex in and of itself. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Environment 1: \u3060 Ellipsed w\/ Nothing Following<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>A feature that nominal predicates and adjectival noun predicates share which adjectival and verbal predicates do not is that the predicate can be inferred without being stated. In other words, \u3060 being removed does not inhibit understanding of the statement itself, whereas if you remove the main adjective or verb from a sentence, inferring it is not impossible but rather difficult. <br><br>This feature of nominal predicates, which for this discussion will include adjectival noun predicates, is so inherent that something as simple as Ex. 53 can be easily understood.<br><br>53. \u3053\u308c\u3001\u925b\u7b46\u3002<br>This, pencil. <br><br>Even in English, putting aside any connotation to the speaker&#8217;s competence and how infantile of a means to create a declarative sentence this may sound, the sentence is still understandable. While it may be tempting to conclude from this that \u3060 is not integral to &#8220;X is Y&#8221; if at an infantile understanding it is not needed to make said statements, this again ignores deep sentence structure and ignores the fact that inference necessitates something to infer. Furthermore, whether we can infer what structures are at play or should or could be present speaks all the more to their existence, and not to throwing the grammar out the window.<br><br>As far as how modality might play a role in this environment, it is worth noting that &#8220;X, Y&#8221; is not inherently infantile in tone as its English equivalent is. If anything, one could imagine someone pointing incessantly at what Y is to get the listener to put two and two together. That, too, would be a reflection of their conviction and the tone that they are setting, all tying back to the notion that &#8220;low modality&#8221; is not the same thing as &#8220;no modality.&#8221;   <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Environment 2: \u3060 Not Ellipsed w\/ Nothing Else<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>When sentence-final \u3060 is not ellipsed and nothing else follows it, it can express a wide variety of modality-based nuances, which can then be further analyzed by whether male and female speakers would be likely to sound that way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Applications Used by Men &amp; Women<\/h6>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2460Emotional Outbursts<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often with dragged-out intonation, emotional outbursts utilizing \u3060 help portray a range of emotional responses, including but not limited to disbelief, dismay, shock, etc.  <br><br>54. \u5618\u3060\uff01<br>No way!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>55. \u3082\u3046\u3001\u3060\u3081\u3060\u3002<br>It&#8217;s no use!<br><br>56. \u30db\u30f3\u30c8\u3060\uff01<br>It really is!<br><br>57. \u3042\u3042\u3001\u3082\u3046\u6642\u9593\u3060\uff01<br>Ugh, time&#8217;s already run out!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2461Discontent\/Criticism<br><br>Not to be confused with outright discontent\/criticism, which would still be well within \u3060&#8217;s realm of utility but not necessarily unisex in tonality, often when preceded by pause, \u3060 can be used to objectify discontent\/criticism directed at someone else as a means of confirming what the deal is. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>58 \u3056\u307e\u3042\u307f\u308d\uff08\u3001\uff09\u3060\u3002<br>That would be what (they) get.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2462Discovery<br><br>The more shocked a speaker is at finding something and realizes that what they have discovered and\/or witnessing is real, the likelier \u3060 might be used in this context to capture the moment. <br><br>59. \u304a\u3063\u3001\u6edd\u3060\uff01<br>Wow, it&#8217;s a waterfall!<br><br>60. \u3046\u308f\u3042\u3001\u718a\u3060\uff01<br>Oh no, it&#8217;s a bear!<br><br>61. \u3042\u3063\u305f\uff01\u3053\u308c\u3060\uff01<br>Aha, here it is!

While \uff5e\u3060\u3055 is not allowed in standardized speech, it may be present in isolated dialects throughout East Japan. <br>2. The final particle \u3058\u3083\u3093 is itself a form of the copula, thus using it in combination with \u3060 would be grammatically redundant.<br>3. While \u3060 would still be expected in the deep sentence structure, \uff5e\u3060\u304b is not grammatical in the surface sentence structure in sentence-final position. This may be due to \u304b playing a copular role but for interrogative sentences in independent clauses. If so, this would imply at some level that \u3067\u3059 functions less as a copula verb and more as a politeness marker in \u3067\u3059\u304b even when paired with nominal predicates<sup data-fn=\"b2ce11f1-d4ee-4829-bc9a-d760de43f3d8\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#b2ce11f1-d4ee-4829-bc9a-d760de43f3d8\" id=\"b2ce11f1-d4ee-4829-bc9a-d760de43f3d8-link\">17<\/a><\/sup>.<br>4.
