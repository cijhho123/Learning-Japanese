In Japanese, these words function as adverbial pronouns. Meaning, depending on the grammatical context, they may either function as either nouns or adverbs. The same dynamic applies when \u3082 attaches to an interrogative. To what degree, though, an &#8220;Interrogative + \u3082&#8221; phrase can function as a standalone noun and be modified by case particles is a rather complicated matter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let&#8217;s familiarize ourselves with the most important interrogatives found in Modern Japanese paired with \u3082 once more and how they translate&nbsp;in affirmative and negative contexts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td><strong>&nbsp;Base Interrogative<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;+\u3082<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;Affirmative<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;Negative<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\u3044\u3064 (When)<\/td><td>\u3044\u3064\u3082<\/td><td>Always\/Usual(ly)<\/td><td>\u2205<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u3069\u3053 (Where)<\/td><td>\u3069\u3053\u3082<\/td><td>Anywhere<sup data-fn=\"1c9d5803-8a1c-43a8-8aa7-7e406917a7f1\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#1c9d5803-8a1c-43a8-8aa7-7e406917a7f1\" id=\"1c9d5803-8a1c-43a8-8aa7-7e406917a7f1-link\">1<\/a><\/sup><\/td><td>Nowhere<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u8ab0\u30fb\u3069\u306a\u305f (Who)<\/td><td>\u8ab0\u3082\u30fb\u3069\u306a\u305f\u3082<\/td><td>Anyone\/Everyone<\/td><td>No one\/nobody<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u4f55 (What)<\/td><td>\u4f55\u3082\uff08\u304b\u3082\uff09<\/td><td>Everything<\/td><td>Nothing<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u3069\u308c<br>\u3069\u3061\u3089<br>\u3069\u3063\u3061 (Which)<\/td><td>\u3069\u308c\u3082<br>\u3069\u3061\u3089\u3082<br>\u3069\u3063\u3061\u3082<\/td><td>Any of them<br>Either ~both<\/td><td>None of them\/Neither<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u3069\u3046 (How)<\/td><td>\u3069\u3046\u3082<\/td><td>Somehow\/absolutely<\/td><td>No matter how<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u3044\u304b\u306b (How)<\/td><td>\u3044\u304b\u306b\u3082<\/td><td>Absolutely\/truly<\/td><td>\u2205<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these words are primarily used as adverbs, as \u3082 itself is an adverbial particle.  Some, however, may function as nouns in varying but limited capacities, which hints at the slow but ongoing process of \u3082 becoming lexicalized in these expressions as part of a greater adverbial noun. For instance, \u3069\u308c\u3082, \u8ab0\u3082, as well as \u4f55\u3082\u304b\u3082 allow for the particle \u304c to follow them (Ex. 20), in which case they are clearly being used as nouns and as the subject. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>20. \u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u7d4c\u6e08\u304c\u7121\u50b7\u3067\u9003\u3052\u5207\u308c\u308b\u3068\u8ab0\u3082\u304c<sup data-fn=\"719a6d0b-d023-4a36-89e6-35a60262f940\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#719a6d0b-d023-4a36-89e6-35a60262f940\" id=\"719a6d0b-d023-4a36-89e6-35a60262f940-link\">2<\/a><\/sup>\u4fe1\u3058\u3066\u3044\u308b\u308f\u3051\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>It is not that case that everyone believes that the Russian economy will be completely able to run away (from the situation) without injury.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of \u8ab0\u3082 as a noun is only truly seen with the particle \u304c, but in recent decades, \u8ab0\u3082\u306b in the same sense as \u7686\u306b albeit with a negative undertone, is becoming accepted.
