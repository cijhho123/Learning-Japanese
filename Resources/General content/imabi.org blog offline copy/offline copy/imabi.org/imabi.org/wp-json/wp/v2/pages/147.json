God\/kami exist.<br><br><strong>Sentence Note<\/strong>: Ignoring the various interpretations of the word \u795e, describing a spiritual entity with \u3044\u308b is most common in modern speech, but that does not detract from the grammaticality of using \u3042\u308b, especially when it is spelled as \u5b58\u308b. As for the use of \u5b58\u5728\u3059\u308b, this is the formal word for &#8220;to exist.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Returning back to Ex. 31, 31a reflects how \u3042\u308b was widely used&nbsp;to express the existence of people in slightly older Japanese. In typical spoken language, this sentence would be rendered in various ways: by switching to \u3044\u308b, paraphrasing out the existential verb (31c), or using \u304a\u308b, which is a dialectal variant of \u3044\u308b that is incredibly common throughout Japan.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>31a.&nbsp;\u5927\u6614\u3001\u3042\u308b\u6240\u306b\u304a\u3058\u3044\u3055\u3093\u3068\u304a\u3070\u3042\u3055\u3093\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>31b. \u5927\u6614\u3001\u3042\u308b\u6240\u306b\u304a\u3058\u3044\u3055\u3093\u3068\u304a\u3070\u3042\u3055\u3093\u304c\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>31c. \u5927\u6614\u3001\u3042\u308b\u6240\u306b\u304a\u3058\u3044\u3055\u3093\u3068\u304a\u3070\u3042\u3055\u3093\u304c\u4f4f\u3093\u3067\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>31d. \u5927\u6614\u3001\u3042\u308b\u6240\u306b\u304a\u3058\u3044\u3055\u3093\u3068\u304a\u3070\u3042\u3055\u3093\u304c\u304a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>A long time ago, there was an old man and an old woman.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common Mistakes <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that the English expression &#8220;there is&#8221; has a broader range than its equivalent Japanese words \u3042\u308b and \u3044\u308b.
