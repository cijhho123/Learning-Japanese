What often gets missed is how exactly they work. <br><br>Although final particles seldom appear in the written language, they are used in nearly every sentence in the spoken language, bringing about countless cues into how both the speaker and learner are interacting, but it would be a mistake to assume that they solely pertain to emotional cues.<br><br>In this lesson, we will delve into how \u305e and \u305c are used from grammatical, historical, and social angles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Final Particle \u305e<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two primary usages of the particle \u305e:<br><br>i.

The tone associated with Usage i is fairly neutral but reflective of its place within typical male speech. Usage ii, meanwhile, has a higher propensity to be used by female speakers. Although it is heavily used to push an assertion onto a listener, with the nature of the assertion ranging from being a warning, advice, intimidation, to passing on the speaker&#8217;s judgment. As for warning and advice, they can be attributed to cordial discord between any speaker regardless of gender or age bracket provided the listener is either equal or lower in status. <br><br>1. \u4f55\u304b\u5909\u3060\u305e\u3002(Usage i\/ii)<br>Something&#8217;s strange. <br><br>2. \u4eca\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3068\u3001\u5931\u6557\u3059\u308b\u305e\u3002(Usage ii)<br>If you don\u2019t do it now, you\u2019ll fail!<br><br>3. \u52c9\u5f37\u3057\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u304b\u3089\u3001\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306b\u5408\u683c\u3057\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3060\u305e\u3002(Usage ii)<br>It\u2019s because you didn\u2019t study that you didn\u2019t pass your test!<br><br>4. \u3053\u308c\u306f\u5f31\u3063\u305f\u305e\u3002(Usage i)<br>I&#8217;m stumped.<br><br>5. \u8cea\u554f\u3055\u308c\u305f\u65b9\u306b\u7121\u793c\uff5b\u3060\u30fb\u3067\u3042\u308b<sup data-fn=\"fd00bde8-211a-4c26-813f-d4da987852eb\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#fd00bde8-211a-4c26-813f-d4da987852eb\" id=\"fd00bde8-211a-4c26-813f-d4da987852eb-link\">1<\/a><\/sup>\uff5d\u305e\u3002(Usage ii)<br>That&#8217;s rude to the person who asked the question. <br><br>6. \u300c\u306a\u3093\u3060\u3001\u3053\u3044\u3064\uff1f\u300d\u300c\u3042\u308c\u306f\u4eba\u9593\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u305e\uff01\u6c17\u3092\u3064\u3051\u308d\uff01\u300d<br>&#8220;What&#8217;s up with this guy?&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s not a human!

Self-Affirmation<br>ii. Disdain\/Scornful Tone<br>iii. To call attention to something.<br>iv. To warn of something in a detached tone.<br><br>Usage i is notably different from the other three usages in that it is used without assuming there is a listener to hear and\/or respond to the statement. Usage ii is similar in how the speaker blurts out what is on their mind, but the scornful tone comes from knowing that the listener is there but not expected to respond. For Usage i or Usage ii, you may see it used in conjunction with the auxiliary \uff5e\u3060\u308d\u3046, which pertains to second\/third-person judgment calls, but its appearance does not detract from the speaker being convinced at that moment of what is being said.<br><br>9. \u884c\u304f\u305c\uff01(Usage i)<br>Here (I\/we) go!<br><br>10. \u307e\u3063\u3074\u3089\u3054\u3081\u3093\u3060\u305c\u3002(Usage ii)<br>Not a chance from me! <br><br>11. \u30bd\u30d5\u30a1\u3067\u5bdb\u3050\u6642\u9593\u306f\u3001\u5bb6\u4e8b\u3084\u4ed5\u4e8b\u3092\u5fd8\u308c\u4f55\u306b\u3082\u3057\u306a\u3044\u305c\u3002<br>Forget choirs or work, I do freakin&#8217; nothin&#8217; when I&#8217;m relaxing on the sofa!<br><br>Meanwhile Usages iii-iv pertain to actively provoking the listener&#8217;s evaluation, but the exact tone will rely heavily on context as to whether the sentence is still cordial or rude.

Meanwhile, with \u305e\u30fb\u305c in their respective contexts, the judgement is made at the time of utterance, which is proven by how both may be used in the sense of self-affirmation. <br><br>16a. \u3053\u3053\u306e\u6e6f\u306f\u71b1\u3044\u3088\u3002<br>16b. \u3053\u3053\u306e\u6e6f\u306f\u71b1\u3044\u305e\u3002<br>16c. \u3053\u3053\u306e\u6e6f\u306f\u71b1\u3044\u305c\u3002<br>The hot spring here is hot!<br><br>In 16a., the speaker likely knows that the hot spring is hot from previous experience or could have deduced that well before uttering the comment. In 16b., it sounds as though the speaker just found out that the hot spring is pretty hot and is warning the listener. 16c is largely synonymous with 16b, but depending on the overall tone and relationship between the speaker and listener, the speaker could also be facetious. <br><br>Moreover, though, because the predicates that they are attached to are said to be convictions which the speaker believes to be true, this necessitates the use of the copula before them in noun-predicates. This point, though, does not fully distinguish them from the particle \u3088, which is also declarative but allows for copula ellipsion. How they differ is when that determination is made. <br><br>17a. \u300c\u8ab0\u304c\u6765\u305f\uff1f\u300d\u300c\u3042\u3001\u30c6\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u541b\uff08\u3060\uff09\u3088\u300d<br>17b. \u300c\u8ab0\u304c\u6765\u305f\uff1f\u300d\u300c\u3042\u3001\u30c6\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u541b\u3060\uff5b\u305e\u30fb\u305c\uff5d\u300d<br><br>Putting aside that the ellipsing of \u3060 in 17a is attributed to female speech, the ability to drop the copula still results in the declarative nature of the sentence fully resting on \u3088. Meanwhile, \u305e\u30fb\u305c, though declarative in tone as well, are used more so direct attention with an ulterior effect. \u305e sounds like a cordial yet stern warning from an equal or lesser, whereas \u305c may range from a warning to a crass\/indifferent response with possible cordial undertones depending on the social dynamics between the speaker and listener (think back to Ex. 15). <br><br>This discrepancy is actually what allows for the combinations \u305c\u3088 and \u305e\u3088, which although not found in Standard Japanese grammar, \u305c\u30fb\u305e can be viewed as establishing a tone which draws in the listener&#8217;s attention while \u3088 establishes the speaker&#8217;s statement as a known fact from their perspective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gender Perception of \u305e &amp; \u305c in <em>Modern<\/em> Japanese<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The perception that \u305e and \u305c are both representative of male speech is a deeply rooted opinion among both native speakers and advanced second-language speakers of the language, though range of tones and nuances that they provide do transcend the notion of &#8216;gendered speech.&#8217; However, understanding the current gender perceptions of these particles can still tell us a lot about how they are used.<br><br>When narrowing the scope of the conversation to their iterations as declarative<sup data-fn=\"ff2a10d0-583e-48c0-b481-7e873ea8314f\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#ff2a10d0-583e-48c0-b481-7e873ea8314f\" id=\"ff2a10d0-583e-48c0-b481-7e873ea8314f-link\">4<\/a><\/sup> final particles in Modern Japanese (19th century~), the perception of these being male speech markers began in concurrence with the appearance of \u3066\u3088\u30fb\u3060\u308f\u8a00\u8449, which is just as recent of an invent as \u305e&#8217;s shrinkage<sup data-fn=\"424a2d14-561c-49e7-82b3-7cf4f3fa8144\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#424a2d14-561c-49e7-82b3-7cf4f3fa8144\" id=\"424a2d14-561c-49e7-82b3-7cf4f3fa8144-link\">5<\/a><\/sup> in usage. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Use of \u305e  in \u639b\u3051\u58f0 (Shouts of Encouragement)<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>When \u305e is taught, attention is given to how it projects a message, often in the same breath as it being indicative of male speech despite phrases like:<br><br>18. \u304c\u3093\u3070\u308b\u305e\uff01<br>I&#8217;ll do my best! <br><br>19. \u3044\u3044\u305e\uff01<br>Way to go!<br><br>Yet, it is this usage that is precisely the most neutral in gender perception, being akin to \u639b\u3051\u58f0 that is intended to a listener or a group of listeners. Rather than being inherently masculine, these phrases out to be interpreted with the lighthearted tone exemplary of \u305e, which adds a sense of encouragement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vulgar Speech\/Toxic Masculinity w\/ \u305e<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>An aspect of \u305e which does appear to have manly undertones is its use in providing warnings or purveying intimidation.

While it is true that \u305e may be overused by said speakers, \u305e these contexts only account for a small percentage of utterances made with \u305e.<br><br>22. \u3068\u306b\u304b\u304f\u5bb6\u3078\u5e30\u308b\u305e\u3002<br>Anyway, I\u2019m goin&#8217; home.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gender Neutrality<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon further investigation, though, there is a plethora of situations in which \u305e is clearly gender neutrality, many of which do pertain to warnings\/intimidation, albeit in a far more lighthearted manner &#8211; often taking out the declarative force that \u305e could otherwise have. <br><br>23. \u304a\u83d3\u5b50\u304f\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3068\u30a4\u30bf\u30ba\u30e9\u3057\u3061\u3083\u3046\u305e\u3002<br>Trick or treat. <br><br><strong>Tone Note<\/strong>: Though \u305e inherently indicates strong conviction, there are set phrases such as Ex. 23 in which the speaker cannot and should not be taken literally. This change in tone perception is also grammatical in nature. If the truth claim behind \u305e is not always taken at face value depending on the tone of the speaker, that means its modality (how the agent&#8217;s behavior is perceived) is subject to context.<br><br>24. \u3042\u30fc\u3001\u3060\u3081\uff01\u3053\u307c\u3059\u305e\uff01<br>Ah, stop!

The conviction that the drink will spill is certainly there, preserving the typical modality judgment behind \u305e, but the tone is lighthearted enough to be used by both mother and father and to not cause the child to necessarily cry. <br><br>25. \u96e8\u964d\u3063\u3066\u304d\u305f\u305e\u3002<br>Hey look, it&#8217;s starting to rain.<br><br><strong>Tone Note<\/strong>: Comments about the weather are unique in their relation with modality.

When these combinations occur, the speaker is still maintaining politeness speech while also firmly stating their position, which is often not done in the greater Japanese society, much less by women. Of course, neither \uff5e\u3067\u3059\u305e nor \uff5e\u307e\u3059\u305e would ever be directed at a superior, but colloquial markers would be avoided altogether once honorific speech norms take over.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>27. \u4eca\u65e5\u3082\u5143\u6c17\u3067\u3059\u305e\u30fc\uff01<br>I&#8217;m chipper as ever today!<br><br>28. \u305d\u308c\u306f\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb\u304c\u4f4e\u3059\u304e\u307e\u3059\u305e\u3002<br>That&#8217;s such a low bar to cross.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Modern Perception of \u305c as being Masculine<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, as for \u305c&#8217;s modern usage, its association with male speech is far stronger, and this is likely due to it being more likely used in superficially polite tones, which would be too uncouth for the speech of &#8216;traditional&#8217; female speech.

In Modern Japanese, \u305c\u3088 lives on as a quasi-dialectal marker indicative of the Tosa Dialect in particular due to certain historical figures such as Sakamoto Ry\u043e\u0304ma \u5742\u672c\u9f8d\u99ac having famously used the ending profusely, yet most speakers of Modern Tosa Dialect no longer employ its use<sup data-fn=\"f35ae35a-70da-4d97-9d53-c72d235e8feb\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#f35ae35a-70da-4d97-9d53-c72d235e8feb\" id=\"f35ae35a-70da-4d97-9d53-c72d235e8feb-link\">15<\/a><\/sup>, but it is worth noting that it had become synonymous with \uff5e\u305e\u3088 in this region, even appearing in cordial yet inquisitive questions. <br><br>53. \u4eca\u65e5\u3042\u3093\u305f\u3089\u4eca\u4f55\u3057\u306b\u6765\u3086\u3046\u304c<sup data-fn=\"eafe5eb7-29e4-494d-a925-4d55f275c9b0\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#eafe5eb7-29e4-494d-a925-4d55f275c9b0\" id=\"eafe5eb7-29e4-494d-a925-4d55f275c9b0-link\">16<\/a><\/sup>\u305c\u3088\uff1f\uff08\u571f\u4f50\u5f01\u30fb\u5b89\u82b8\u5e02)<br>What&#8217;s brought you guys here today\uff1f<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u53c2\u7167<br><a href=\"https:\/\/intojapanwaraku.com\/rock\/culture-rock\/158011\/\n\">https:\/\/intojapanwaraku.com\/rock\/culture-rock\/158011\/<br><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/headjockaa.g1.xrea.com\/realjp\/zo.html\">http:\/\/headjockaa.g1.xrea.com\/realjp\/zo.html<\/a><br><a href=\"https:\/\/hermes-ir.lib.hit-u.ac.jp\/hermes\/ir\/re\/17613\/ryugaku0001200030.pdf\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/hermes-ir.lib.hit-u.ac.jp\/hermes\/ir\/re\/17613\/ryugaku0001200030.pdf\">\u300c\u3060\u308d\u3046\u300d\u3068\u7d42\u52a9\u8a5e\u306e\u5171\u8d77\u6761\u4ef6 by \u4e09\u679d\u4ee4\u5b50<\/a>.<br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/jcss\/4\/2\/4_2_2_39\/_article\/-char\/ja\/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/jcss\/4\/2\/4_2_2_39\/_article\/-char\/ja\/\">\u968e\u5c64\u7684\u8a18\u61b6\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306b\u3088\u308b\u7d42\u52a9\u8a5e\u300c\u3088\u300d\u300c\u306d\u300d\u300c\u306a\u300d\u300c\u305c\u300d\u300c\u305e\u300d\u306e\u610f\u5473\u8ad6 by \u5c0f\u91ce\u664b\u30fb\u4e2d\u5ddd\u88d5\u5fd7<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-footnotes\"><li id=\"fd00bde8-211a-4c26-813f-d4da987852eb\">The purposeful use of \u3067\u3042\u308b does help interject a scornful tone towards the listener, heightening the statement as a proper warning.  <a href=\"#fd00bde8-211a-4c26-813f-d4da987852eb-link\" aria-label=\"\u811a\u6ce8\u53c2\u71671\u306b\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\">\u21a9\ufe0e<\/a><\/li><li id=\"520e08a8-6fdd-46d6-9ca7-a461cb57ded0\">This statement is only true of the final particle declarative renditioning of \u305e. <a href=\"#520e08a8-6fdd-46d6-9ca7-a461cb57ded0-link\" aria-label=\"\u811a\u6ce8\u53c2\u71672\u306b\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\">\u21a9\ufe0e<\/a><\/li><li id=\"32efccc6-e34f-4e44-b513-b95f0771a7f0\">In the case of \u304b, the success\/failure or true\/false evaluation of the statement itself is being posited, not affirmed.
