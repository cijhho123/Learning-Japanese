When describing the color of things in Japanese, there are three factor to keep in mind.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Factor 1 is&nbsp;<strong>grammatical implication<\/strong>. Japanese color words have nominal, adjectival, and adverbial forms. These forms are all derived no differently than other words, but some colors will notably have alternative adjectival forms.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Factor 2 is&nbsp;<strong>cultural&nbsp;perception<\/strong>. The sky is &#8220;blue&#8221; to English and Japanese speakers, but what about the sun? If you tell English-speaking elementary students to paint a picture of the sun, the majority will color it orange. Adult English speakers might akin the color to &#8220;white,&#8221; but &#8220;red&#8221; is not typically what comes to mind. However, to Japanese speakers, \u8d64 (red) is the color attributed to the sun. The reason for this&nbsp;will be described later in this lesson, but it just goes to show that people don&#8217;t view the world with the same&nbsp;<strong>cultural<\/strong>&nbsp;lenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Factor 3 is&nbsp;<strong>specific hue reference<\/strong>. English and Japanese have their distinct cultural spins on how the colors of things are described, but they are also major world languages which have developed their own repertoires of hue names. Generally speaking, any specific hue name in English has a Japanese equivalent, and there are also historical\/culturally unique names. For instance, &#8220;sky blue&#8221; is described in Japanese as \u7a7a\u8272.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>First, we&#8217;ll learn about what the basic color words are to English and Japanese speakers respectively while simultaneously also going over any grammar which needs to be reviewed upon using the Japanese words.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Basic\u00a0Color Words in English\u3000<br>\u82f1\u8a9e\u570f\u3067\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u8272\u540d<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>English has 11 basic colors: black, white, red, green, yellow, blue, pink, grey, brown, orange, and purple. Japanese has words for all these colors, but you will notice some of them containing the word&nbsp;\u8272\uff08\u3044\u308d\uff09, which incidentally means &#8220;color.&#8221; The reason for why it&#8217;s in those words is a grammar question we&#8217;ll get to later, so for now just familiarize with what&#8217;s in the chart below.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td><strong>&nbsp;Color (ENG)<\/strong>\u57fa\u672c\u8272\u540d\uff08\u82f1\u8a9e\uff09<\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;Nominal Form<\/strong><strong>\u540d\u8a5e\u5f62<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;Adjectival Form<\/strong>\u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e\u5f62<\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;Adverbial Form<\/strong><strong>\u526f\u8a5e\u5f62<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Black<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9ed2\uff08\u8272\uff09<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9ed2\u3044<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9ed2\u304f<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;White<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u767d\uff08\u8272\uff09<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u767d\u3044<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u767d\u304f<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Red<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u8d64\uff08\u8272\uff09<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u8d64\u3044<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u8d64\u304f<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Green<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7dd1(\u8272)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7dd1\u8272\u306e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7dd1\u8272\u306b<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Yellow<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9ec4(\u8272)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9ec4\u8272\u3044\u30fb\u9ec4(\u8272)\u306e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9ec4\u8272\u304f\u30fb\u9ec4\u8272\u306b<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Blue<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9752<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9752\u3044<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9752\u304f<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Pink<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u30d4\u30f3\u30af\uff08\u8272\uff09<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u30d4\u30f3\u30af\u8272\u306e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u30d4\u30f3\u30af\u8272\u306b<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Grey<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7070\u8272<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7070\u8272\u306e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7070\u8272\u306b<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Brown<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u8336\u8272<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u8336\u8272\u3044\u30fb\u8336\u8272\u306e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u8336\u8272\u304f\u30fb\u8336\u8272\u306b<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Orange<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u30aa\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\uff08\u8272\uff09<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u30aa\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u8272\u306e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u30aa\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u8272\u306b<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Purple<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7d2b(\u8272)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7d2b(\u8272)\u306e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7d2b\u8272\u306b<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: When \uff5e\u8272 attaches to color words but is not required in all instances, it serves the same role as &#8220;color&#8221; would in English when saying &#8220;the color red.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u6f22\u5b57 Note<\/strong>: \u8272\u540d is either read as \u3044\u308d\u3081\u3044 or \u3057\u304d\u3081\u3044. \u8272 has the ON readings \u30b7\u30e7\u30af\u30fb\u30b7\u30ad and the KUN reading \u3044\u308d.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u96f2\u306f\u306a\u305c<strong>\u767d\u3044<\/strong>\u3093\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>Why are clouds white?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u9053\u7aef\u3067<strong>\u7d2b\uff08\u8272\uff09\u306e<\/strong>\u77f3\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u3002<br>I found a purple stone on the side of the road.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>\u9ed2\u3044<\/strong>\u7159\u306b\u306f\u6709\u6bd2\u30ac\u30b9\u304c\u542b\u307e\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002<br>There are poisonous gases contained in the black smoke.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u80f8\u306b<strong>\u8336\u8272\u3044<\/strong>\u75e3\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u3082\u306e\u304c\u3067\u304d\u305f\u3002<br>A brown bruise-like thing has formed on my chest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.\u00a0<strong>\u30aa\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\uff08\u8272\uff09\u306e<\/strong>\u7a7a\u3092\u898b\u4e0a\u3052\u305f\u3002<br>I looked up at the orange sky.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.&nbsp;<strong>\u30d4\u30f3\u30af\uff08\u8272\uff09\u306e<\/strong>\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9\u3092\u7740\u305f\u5973\u306e\u5b50\u304c\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>There is a girl wearing a pink(-colored)&nbsp;dress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7a.&nbsp;\u3069\u3046\u3057\u3066\u96e8\u96f2\u306f<strong>\u9ed2\uff08\u3044\uff09\u8272\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b<\/strong>\u3093\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>Why are rain clouds black?<br>Literally: Why do rain clouds bear black color(s)?&nbsp;<br>7b. \u3069\u3046\u3057\u3066\u96e8\u96f2\u306f<strong>\u9ed2\u3044<\/strong>\u3093\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>Why are rain clouds black?<br><br><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: \u8272\u3092\u3059\u308b means &#8220;to bear color.&#8221; In the case of Ex. 7, it is perfectly grammatical to still just use the basic adjectival form of &#8220;black,&#8221; but the use of&nbsp;&nbsp;\u8272\u3092\u3059\u308b in 7a. emphasizes the color as a characteristic.

Since the basic color words are nouns, one would expect contexts where they can still modify a word but retain that noun status.&nbsp;An&nbsp;example of this is the use of&nbsp;\u8d64\u3068\u9752\u306e in Ex. 19 as opposed to \u8d64\u3067\u9752\u306e.

Over the course of Japanese evolution, two more color words gained \u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e forms: \u8336\u8272 (brown) \u2192 \u8336\u8272\u3044 and \u9ec4\u8272 (yellow) \u2192 \u9ec4\u8272\u3044. These colors are said to have been the next two color expressions added to the pre-existing four, which is what led them to receive these forms. Generally speaking, these forms are interchangeable with their \u306e-adjective forms, which is a difference between the basic four color words.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>22a.&nbsp;<strong>\u9ec4\u8272\u3044<\/strong>\u8eca\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>22b.&nbsp;<strong>\u9ec4\u8272\u306e<\/strong>\u8eca\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>I bought a yellow car.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are situations in which only the \u306e-adjective form can be used, and those situations mirror the ones in which those forms are used for the basic four colors. Imagine a show in which a contestant must choose between five boxes. Each box is the same color minus the ribbon on top. The color of the ribbons are all unique without repetitions. In this situation, the \u306e-adjective form must be used across the board.

Once 4 &#8216;primary&#8217; colors&nbsp;were coined, they did not initially refer to specific colors, which has influenced their use to this day. These four words are&nbsp;none other than&nbsp;\u8d64, \u9ed2, \u767d, and \u9752. Let&#8217;s take a look at their history and see how their ancient origins tell us&nbsp;a lot about how these words are used to this day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. The word [aka] comes from the verb [aku] meaning &#8220;to dawn&#8221; (Mod. \u660e\u3051\u308b). Although it often referred to the color &#8220;red&#8221; even in ancient times, its primary meaning was &#8220;bright.&#8221; It is because of this that the &#8220;Sun&#8221; is often described as \u8d64\u3044 even though other colors may more accurately describe how the naked eye perceives it. Eventually, the meaning of &#8220;bright&#8221; was taken over by the adjective \u660e\u308b\u3044, which comes from the verb form&nbsp;\u660e\u304b\u308b, further demonstrating the original meaning of [aka].&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. The word [kuro] shares the same origin as the word \u6697\u3044. At the early onset, they would have been different renditions of the same word, and over time [kuro] specifically referred to &#8220;black&#8221; whereas [kurai] retaining its meaning of &#8220;dark.&#8221; Looking further back in time, it is apparent that both adjectives originate from the verb [kuru] meaning &#8220;to get dark&#8221; (Mod. \u66ae\u308c\u308b).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. The word [shiro] comes from the verb \u3057\u308b\u3059. Putting aside the various Kanji used to write the verb, its general meaning is &#8220;to make clear.&#8221; Even in ancient times, [shiro]&nbsp;was used to mean &#8220;white,&#8221; but&nbsp;it&nbsp;also retained the literal meaning of &#8220;clear\/deep&#8221; colors. Eventually, this meaning was lost and now [shiro] just means &#8220;white.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. The word [ao] may be related to the&nbsp;adjective \u6de1\u3044 meaning &#8220;light (hue),&#8221; but it may also be related to the word \u9593 (between) to be the intermediary word between \u767d and \u9ed2 in the minds of the ancient Japanese. This would explain why it still often means &#8220;grey&#8221; such as in the expression \u84bc\u3044\u6708 (Kanji difference to be explained later) as well as &#8220;pale&#8221; when in reference to someone&#8217;s face. Until the word became fixated to mean &#8220;blue,&#8221; it also&nbsp;became associated with freshness\/immaturity, which led to its meaning of &#8220;green&#8221; in many expressions related to green goods such as \u9752\u308a\u3093\u3054 (green apples) and most famously \u9752\u4fe1\u53f7 (green light).&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>27. \u592a\u967d\u306f<strong>\u8d64\u304f<\/strong>\u71c3\u3048\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002<br>The Sun burns red.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>28. \u305d\u306e\u90e8\u5c4b\u306f<strong>\u9752\u3044<\/strong>\u6708\u306b\u7167\u3089\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002<br>The room was being lit up by the pale moon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>29. \u57ce\u5185\u3067\u306f\u8349\u6728\u304c<strong>\u9752\u304f<\/strong>\u8302\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002<br>The vegetation at the castle is growing nice and green.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>30. \u5199\u771f\u306b\u306f\u5149\u306e\u52a0\u6e1b\u3067<strong>\u9ed2\u304f<\/strong>\u5199\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u90e8\u5206\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002<br>Some parts of the picture appear black due to the lighting.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>31.\u00a0<strong>\u9752<\/strong>\u4fe1\u53f7\u3060\u304c\u3001\u53f3\u6298\u306f\u77e2\u5370\u4fe1\u53f7\u512a\u5148\u3060\u3088\u3002<br>Although the light is green, right turns have priority when they have an arrow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Five &#8216;Colors&#8217;\u3000<br>\u4e94\u8272\uff08\u3054\u3057\u304d\uff09<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Based in Wuxing (Five Phases) philosophy (\u9670\u967d\u4e94\u884c\u8aac), which is a five-fold scheme used in traditional Chinese fields to explain many phenomena in the world, there are five colors that have held major cultural significance in Japanese as a result. The five colors of this philosophy are \u9752 (associated with the element \u6728 = wood)\u30fb\u8d64 (associated with the element \u706b = fire)\u30fb\u9ec4 (associated with the element \u571f = earth)\u30fb\u767d (associated with the element \u91d1 = metal)\u30fb\u9ed2 (associated with the element \u6c34 = water)&nbsp;in that order.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Seven &#8216;Colors&#8217; of the Rainbow\u3000<br>\u8679\u306e\u4e03\u8272<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept of there being seven colors in the rainbow is a direct borrowing from the West, but these seven colors of the rainbow have been borrowed verbatim with no alteration: \u8d64 (red)\u30fb\u6a59 (orange)\u30fb\u9ec4 (yellow)\u30fb\u7dd1 (green)\u30fb\u9752 (blue)\u30fb\u85cd (indigo)\u30fb\u7d2b (purple).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Color Words by Category\u3000<br>\u8272\u7cfb\u7d71\u5225\u306e\u8272\u540d\u4e00\u89a7<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From a physics standpoint, there are three primary colors \uff08\u539f\u8272 \u3052\u3093\u3057\u3087\u304f\uff09of light: \u8d64 (red), \u7dd1 (green), and \u9752 (blue).

When describing the eyes, it&#8217;s important to remind ourselves that the color being referenced is found in the iris (\u8679\u5f69) and that the pupil (\u77b3\u30fb\u77b3\u5b54) is black (\u9ed2\u76ee) for all humans. \u9ed2\u76ee can both refer to the iris as well as a dark-colored iris. In the English-speaking world, this color would be referred to as &#8220;dark brown&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;black.&#8221; This is because &#8220;black eye&#8221; refers to bruising that occurs around the eye, but this is referred to as \u76ee\u306e\u5468\u308a\u306b\u3067\u304d\u308b\u9752\u75e3 in Japanese, which utilizes the color \u9752 instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, many Japanese are away that eye color may vary between &#8220;brown&#8221; and &#8220;dark brown,&#8221; and there is no problem with describing eye color with \u8336\u8272&nbsp;(brown) or \u7126\u3052\u8336\u8272 (olive brown) if the iris isn&#8217;t close to &#8220;black.&#8221; You may also hear the color \u9cf6\u8272 used to describe the eyes (and hair), which refers to a &#8220;reddish brown\/burnt sienna.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even within the Japanese native population, there are individuals with unique eye colors. One such color is &#8220;hazel&#8221; which can be literally translated as \u6de1\u8910\u8272\uff08\u305f\u3093\u304b\u3063\u3057\u3087\u304f\uff09 (light brown) or \u699b\u8272\uff08\u306f\u3057\u3070\u307f\u3044\u308d\uff09. In literature, \u699b\u8272\u306e\u77b3 is treated as a more exact, standard means of translating &#8220;hazel eyes,&#8221; but in casual conversation as well as advertisement for colored contacts (\u30ab\u30e9\u30b3\u30f3), \u30d8\u30fc\u30bc\u30eb\u30a2\u30a4 can be seen. &nbsp;Furthermore, \u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30a2\u30a4 (brown eyes) and other similar English loanwords are heavily seen in the context of colored contacts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Blue eyes&#8221; and &#8220;green eyes&#8221; seldom&nbsp;do occur naturally in the Japanese population. &#8220;Blue eyes&#8221; can be referred to as \u9752\u3044\u76ee, \u9752\u306e\u76ee, \u9752\u76ee, \u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30a2\u30a4, etc. &#8220;Green eyes&#8221; can be referred to as \u7dd1\u8272\u306e\u76ee or \u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30a2\u30a4. The use of English loanwords as opposed to the native wordings is, again, heavily related to fashion. It&#8217;s also important to note that speakers interchange \u76ee and \u77b3 when referring to the eyes, especially in the context of color.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another eye color that occasionally gets mentioned is &#8220;amber,&#8221; which may be referred to as \u7425\u73c0\u8272\uff08\u3053\u306f\u304f\u3044\u308d\uff09or \u30a2\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30a2\u30a4.

For one,&nbsp;<em>most conversations in Japanese are&nbsp;about Japanese people themselves<\/em>, so contexts regarding skin color are typically through that narrower lens, which has to be understood by someone learning the language who comes from a different cultural background.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Japanese society, white skin has been associated with beautiful skin (\u7f8e\u808c\u30fb\u3073\u306f\u3060). There is even the word \u7f8e\u767d\uff08\u3073\u306f\u304f\uff09 which literally means &#8220;beautifully white,&#8221; which may also refer to whitening of the skin\/teeth.

Furthermore, because&nbsp;the use of \u8272 in \u8272\u767d and \u8272\u9ed2 comes down to appeal, they still mean \u808c\u306e\u8272\u304c\u767d\u3044\u3053\u3068 and \u808c\u306e\u8272\u304c\u9ed2\u3044\u3053\u3068 respectively verbatim.

Many prejudicial thoughts, both with positive and negative connotations, were instilled in Japan by&nbsp;American occupation during the 1950s and\/or were fueled separately by traditionally held beliefs attributed to colors.

Having said this, many Japanese are mature enough to distinguish someone&#8217;s race from the culturally based semantic connotations phrases might have.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When race is mentioned, though, the words for said races are used in much the same way as English.
