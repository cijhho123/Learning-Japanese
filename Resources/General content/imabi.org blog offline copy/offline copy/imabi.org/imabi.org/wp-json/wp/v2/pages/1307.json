The first thing to know is that they were once \u3059 and \u6765 respectively. Their meaning have changed little, so we don&#8217;t have to worry about much semantic change.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u30b5\u884c\u5909\u683c\u52d5\u8a5e<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary verb in this irregular verbal class is \u3059. Its bases are by no means normal, and it can be used in both transitive and intransitive contexts. As a transitive verb, it&#8217;s like &#8220;to do&#8221;. In intransitive contexts, it&#8217;s like &#8220;to exist&#8221; or &#8220;to occur&#8221;.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The other verb in this class is \u304a\u306f\u3059, which is a very honorific verb meaning &#8220;to be\/go\/come&#8221;. Like in Modern Japanese, \u3059 may attach to (Sino-)Japanese nouns to create &#8216;new&#8217; verbs. At times, it may be voiced as \u305a. When the \u7d42\u6b62\u5f62 and \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 became the same for verbs, \u305a\u308b and \u3058\u308b became possible \u7d42\u6b62\u5f62 for these &#8220;\u305a-\u3059verbs&#8221;. The verbs that end in -\u3063\u3059\u308b when \u3059\u308b attaches to a (Sino-)Japanese word ending in \u3059\u308b may also have \u3064 contracted in Classical Japanese. However, it is debatable when the contraction started to reflect in the spoken language.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, \u3059 was the only \u30b5\u5909 verb. As it is such a dynamic word, it just had to be added to other words to create even more verbs. So, when did \u3059 become \u3059\u308b? This change started to take place as early as the end of the \u5e73\u5b89\u6642\u4ee3; both \u3059 and \u3059\u308b hence began being used as interchangeable \u7d42\u6b62\u5f62. The bases for \u30b5\u5909&nbsp; verbs are:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;\u672a\u7136\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9023\u7528\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7d42\u6b62\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9023\u4f53\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5df2\u7136\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u547d\u4ee4\u5f62<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u305b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3057<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3059<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3059\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3059\u308c<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305b\u3088<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bases Notes<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.

When the \u672a\u7136\u5f62 became \u3057, it caused the \u547d\u4ee4\u5f62 to take the form of \u3057\u308d, which is essentially like the \u547d\u4ee4\u5f62 of an \u4e00\u6bb5 verb. \u305b\u3044 comes from the contraction of \u305b\u3088 itself.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>Examples<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u4eac\u306b\u306e\u307c\u308a\u3066<ruby>\u5bae\u4ed5<rt>\u307f\u3084\u3065\u304b<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3078\u3092\u305b\u3088\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the capital and serve for the imperial court!<br>From the \u5927\u548c\u7269\u8a9e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;\u6614\u3001<ruby>\u60df\u55ac<rt>\u3053\u308c\u305f\u304b<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e<ruby>\u89aa\u738b<rt>\u307f\u3053<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3068<ruby>\u7533<rt>\u307e\u3046<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3059\u89aa\u738b\u304a\u306f\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3051\u308a\u3002<br>\u3000\u3000Long ago, there was a prince named Prince Koretaka.<br>From the \u4f0a\u52e2\u7269\u8a9e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u6614\u306e\u4eba\u306e<ruby>\u8896<rt>\u305d\u3067<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e<ruby>\u9999<rt>\u304b<\/rt><\/ruby>\u305e\u3059\u308b\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; It had the scent of the sleeve of a person from the past (whom I knew very well).<br>From the \u53e4\u4eca\u548c\u6b4c\u96c6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u6b7b\u306a\u3080\u85e5\u3082\u4f55\u304b\u306f\u305b\u3080\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; What would I do with death preventing medicine?<br>From the \u7af9\u53d6\u7269\u8a9e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.&nbsp;<ruby>\u9b3c<rt>\u304a\u306b<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e\u3084\u3046\u306a\u308b\u3082\u306e<ruby>\u51fa<rt>\u3044<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3067<ruby>\u4f86<rt>\u304d<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3066\u6bba\u3055\u3080\u3068\u3057\u304d\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Things that looked like demons came out and tried to kill us.<br>From the \u7af9\u53d6\u7269\u8a9e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. \u3044\u3068\u3069\u3042\u306f\u308c\u3068\u3054<ruby>\u89bd<rt>\u3089\u3093<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3058\u3066\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (The emperor) looked with increasing pity (on the Kiritsubo consort).<br>From the \u6e90\u6c0f\u7269\u8a9e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. \u4eba\u3005\u3042\u307e\u305f<ruby>\u8072<rt>\u3053\u3091<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3057\u3066<ruby>\u4f86<rt>\u304f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306a\u308a\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; It sounds as if a lot of people are coming and raising their voices.<br>From the \u5b87\u6cbb\u62fe\u907a\u7269\u8a9e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: The auxiliary verb \uff5e\u306a\u308a shows aural supposition in this example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8.&nbsp;<ruby>\u59bb\u6238<rt>\u3064\u307e\u3069<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3092\u3084\u306f\u3089\u304b\u3044<ruby>\u653e<rt>\u306f\u306a<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3064\u97f3\u3059\u306a\u308a\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; It sounds like (someone) quietly opened up the chamber doors.<br>From the \u5824\u4e2d\u7d0d\u8a00\u7269\u8a9e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9. \u79cb\u306e\u91ce\u306b<ruby>\u4eba\u677e<rt>\u3072\u3068\u307e\u3064<\/rt><\/ruby><ruby>\u87f2<rt>\u3080\u3057<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e\u8072\u3059\u306a\u308a\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; You can hear the voice of the pine cricket while waiting for someone in the autumn fields.<br>From the \u53e4\u4eca\u548c\u6b4c\u96c6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: It is common to have two homophonous words intended at the same time.
