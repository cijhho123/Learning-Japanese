At times may seem as if it is just a filler word, but when we study its use which all natives agree on to be correct, we do find details on how to use it most effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Spelling Note<\/strong>: The \u6f22\u5b57 for \u8a00\u3046 is usually used when the verb is used literally for \u201cto say\u201d. However, it is extremely common in casual texts to see it written out as \u3044\u3046 or even \u3086\u3046. In other usages, the \u3072\u3089\u304c\u306a spellings are more common. Also note that this verb may be spelled as \u4e91\u3046&nbsp;in older spelling when quoting others.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Casual Note<\/strong>: For all usages mentioned in this lesson, the particle \u3068 may be replaced with \u3063\u3066 in casual contexts. If it follows \u3093, \u3066 is usually used instead of \u3063\u3066. Do not confuse this with the conjunctive particle \u3066! The grammars are completely different.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u3068\u3044\u3046<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let&#8217;s remember what \u3068\u3044\u3046 is composed of and why it matters. \u3068 is the citation case particle of Japanese. The phrase it attaches gets grammatically quoted, and it\u2019s always a signal that a citation verb of some sort should follow, and if it doesn\u2019t, that verb is implied. When conjoined with the verb \u8a00\u3046, literally meaning \u201cto say\u201d, we see that it is used to help make phrases able to modify other phrases when otherwise the grammar wouldn\u2019t allow for it. Before we get to far ahead of ourselves, remember that this phrase is used to say \u201cto say\u2026\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u50d5\u306f\u30bb\u30b9\u5148\u751f\u306b\u4f3c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u3001\u305f\u307e\u306b\u8a00\u308f\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>I&#8217;m occasionally told that I resemble Seth-sensei.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next logical leap from this literal usage is to be used to mean &#8220;to be called\/said\/named.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u3055\u3063\u304d\u8cb7\u3063\u305f\u690d\u7269\u304c\u306a\u3093\u3068\u3044\u3046\u690d\u7269\u306a\u306e\u304b\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>It&#8217;s getting to me what plant it was that I bought a while ago.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u5148\u6708\u306e\u53f0\u98a8\u3067\u6c88\u3093\u3060\u306e\u306f\u4f55\u3068\u3044\u3046\u8239\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3063\u3051\u3002<br>Oh, what was the name of that boat that sunk in last month&#8217;s typhoon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u79c1\u306f\u30bb\u30b9\u3068\u7533\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>I&#8217;m Seth.
