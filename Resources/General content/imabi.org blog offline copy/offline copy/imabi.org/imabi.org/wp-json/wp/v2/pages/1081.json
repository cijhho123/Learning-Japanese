This affix can be followed by the adjectival affix \/-ka\/, but a small percentage of those same adjectival roots can be followed by&nbsp;the verbal affix \/-gu\/.&nbsp;For instance, the root \/usu-\/ written as \u8584 in Kanji, means, \u201cthin (object),\u201d and from these aforementioned processes, the following words can be derived: \u3046\u3063\u3059\u3089\uff08\u3068\uff09(faintly), \u8584\u3089\u304b (incredibly thin), \u8584\u3089\u3050 (to become thin\/fade).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The meaning of \/-gu\/, when paired with \/~ra-ya\/ to produce \/-ragu~yagu\/,&nbsp;is more or less synonymous with \uff5e\uff08\u304b\u306e\uff09\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308b, either translating as &#8220;to become\/present such a state&#8221; or &#8220;to act as one has become such a state.&#8221; Due to this very specific nuancing, whereas there around&nbsp;50+ extant examples of \/-raka~yaka\/, there are only six examples of&nbsp;\/-ragu~yagu\/ in Modern Japanese:&nbsp;&nbsp;\u548c\u3089\u3050, \u5b89\u3089\u3050, \u8584\u3089\u3050, \u83ef\u3084\u3050, \u5e73\u3089\u3050,&nbsp;and&nbsp;\u82e5\u3084\u3050.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To fully understand this affix, we&#8217;ll first start off by studying the meanings of these verbs and compare them to any relevant alternative word forms that may exist. Afterward, we&#8217;ll study just a few more examples that existed in Classical Japanese but did not survive into the modern lexicon.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u203bIn Old Japanese, the affix \/-gu\/ is thought to have been devoiced as \/-ku\/, which is how it would appear in works such as the \u4e07\u8449\u96c6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Modern Use of \uff5e\u3089\u3050\u30fb\u3084\u3050<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The very small impact \/-ragu~yagu\/ has had on the Japanese lexicon is likely due to other grammar points being far more useful and so widely used. What can be said by the handful of examples, though, is that each of the six verbs listed above are intransitive. Without further ado, let&#8217;s see how these six verbs behave.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u548c\u3089\u3050<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u548c\u3089\u3050 is a combination of the root \/yawa-\/ meaning &#8220;soft&#8221; combined with \/-ragu\/. It has the four following definitions, which are listed by their frequency in Modern Japanese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2460(For a state that has been severe) to calm down.<br>\u2461(For a stiff atmosphere) to soften.<br>\u2462To become supple. (Archaic)<br>\u2463To become affectionate. (Archaic)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u548c\u3089\u3050 is mostly paired with weather, physical and emotional pain, anger, sadness, etc. entering a calmed state. Although the translation \u201cto be mitigated\/eased\u201d can be seen in dictionaries, it is not typically used in reference to abating man-made rules\/systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Classical Japanese, its primary meaning was to indicate \u201cone\u2019s heart\/mind calming down,\u201d and from this came meaning&nbsp;\u2463, and&nbsp;as for&nbsp;\u2462, this would be the literal meaning of the word inherited from the root.&nbsp;Oddly enough, it\u2019s the sense of emotional relief that led the word to referring to severe mental ailment calming down. Although the weather isn\u2019t necessarily an ailment, severe weather conditions can certainly wain on a person\u2019s mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u6691\u3055\u304c<strong>\u548c\u3089\u3044\u3067<\/strong>\u304f\u308b\u6642\u671f\u3068\u306f\u3044\u3048\u300130\u5ea6\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u71b1\u5e2f\u591c\u3068\u306a\u308b\u65e5\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002<br>Although this is the period when the heat calms down, there are even days where the temperature exceeds 30 degrees, and the nights are sweltering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u306a\u305c\u75db\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3092\u624b\u3067\u62bc\u3055\u3048\u308b\u3068\u75db\u307f\u304c<strong>\u548c\u3089\u3050<\/strong>\u306e\uff1f<br>Why is it that pain eases when you press down on the hurt area with your hand?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u4e00\u5ea6\u3001\u5bd2\u3055\u304c<strong>\u548c\u3089\u3044\u3060<\/strong>\u5f8c\u306b\u6c17\u6e29\u304c\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3059\u308b\u3076\u3093\u3001\u4f59\u8a08\u306b\u5bd2\u304f\u611f\u3058\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3002<br>Once the temperature declines after the cold temperatures have subsided, it feels colder all the more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u5b66\u6821\u3067\u6d3b\u52d5\u304c\u3067\u304d\u3066\u5c11\u3057\u60b2\u3057\u307f\u304c<strong>\u548c\u3089\u3044\u3060<\/strong>\u6c17\u304c\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>I feel like my sadness has subsided a little by being able to do activities at school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. \u4eca\u3001\u3053\u306e\u6cbb\u307e\u308c\u308b\u5fa1\u4ee3\u306b\u968f\u3072\u3001\u3068\u3082\u306b<strong>\u548c\u3089\u304e\u3064\u3064<\/strong>\u2026<br>In accordance with the times being at peace, the two are quite close\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u300e\u304a\u3089\u304c\u6625\u300f\u3088\u308a<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. \u3042\u304b\u304e\u308c\u306a\u3069\u306b\u306f\u3001\u6c34\u304c\u304b\u304b\u308c\u3070\u3053\u3068\u306e\u5916<strong>\u3084\u306f\u3089\u3044\u3067<\/strong>\u3088\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3075\u300d<br>They say that chaffed skin becomes unexpectedly supple when water gets on it.<br>\u300e\u72c2\u8a00\u8a18\u300f\u3088\u308a<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From these examples, it would seem that \u548c\u3089\u3050 is deeply tied to emotional feeling even when it is in reference to weather. We could say that the state being presented by \/-gu\/ in this word is certainly emotional in nature, so let\u2019s see if the other example words tie into human emotion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u5b89\u3089\u3050<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is very little in terms of morphology and grammar that distinguishes \u5b89\u3089\u304b\u306b\u306a\u308b (to feel at ease) and \u5b89\u3089\u3050 (to feel at ease). Both phrases are very composed and solemn in tone, and both are more suited to romanticized language than everyday speech. Of the two, though, it would be the former that is most common in the spoken language, and this may be a consequence of the affix \/-gu\/ being so rare in Modern Japanese.

Although this translation is accurate for all four forms, there are distinct nuances to be aware of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2460\u8584\u304f\u306a\u308b is rather straightforward in that it refers to an object\/thing becoming thin. This change, unless paired with something like \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u304f, isn\u2019t implied to be a gradual change. Rather, the change is being described in the moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2461\u8584\u308c\u308b refers to something that was once clear and distinct becoming weaker and faint over time. It is often used in reference to color, memory, consciousness, etc. It can be accurately translated as \u201cto fade (away)\/thin out.\u201d It is not used in reference to heat\/cold or other physical phenomena that can\u2019t be perceived as \u201cthinning out.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2462\u8584\u307e\u308b refers to concentration\/density thinning out. It is often used in a physical sense in reference to taste, color, etc., but it can also be used in reference to more abstract yet \u201cdeep\u201d things such as suspicion. It can be translated as \u201cto become weak\u201d in the sense of thickness (physical or abstract), but \u201cto become diluted\u201d would also be very accurate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2463\u8584\u3089\u3050 is very similar to \u548c\u3089\u3050 in that it describes sheer intensity, often impressions, gradually becoming less intense over time.

However, unlike the competing adjectival affix \/-ka\/, the verbal affix \/-gu\/ is used with a very small pool of words which has continued shrinking over time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite only appearing in six words in Modern Japanese, these words that survived managed to maintain a distinct meaning of &#8220;to appear\/act&#8230; (a certain state)&#8221; even as other word forms existed for similar function. We even see how transitivity pairs were created from the same \/-gu\/ affix which eventually split into two endings, with the transitive ending \/-geru\/ barely surviving in Modern Japanese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having carefully studied both the adjectival affix \/-ka\/ and the verbal affix \/-gu\/, we have gained an understanding of how the underlying affix \/-ra\/ is used in the Modern Japanese lexicon. For further study, consider the contrast between word forms that involve [-ra\/ya] +&nbsp;[-ka]\/[-gu] and those made by doubling the root + [-shii]. This differentiation was hinted at with \u83ef\u3005\u3057\u3044, \u83ef\u3084\u304b, and \u83ef\u3084\u3050, but we can also see this dynamic more broadly with other word groups such as \u82e5\u3044, \u82e5\u3005\u3057\u3044, \u82e5\u3084\u304b, and \u82e5\u3084\u3050.
