Meaning, the&nbsp;holidays in Japan are not the same holidays as the ones recognized in the US.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few words in Japanese that translate&nbsp;to &#8220;holiday.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>\u4f11\u65e5 can be defined as a &#8220;day one has time off.&#8221; Depending on where you are in the English speaking world, you may describe this as &#8220;on holiday&#8221; or &#8220;on vacation,&#8221; but the point here is that \u4f11\u65e5, simply speaking, is a day that businesses, organizations, schools, and\/or individuals are off from their duties to do as they wish.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u795d\u65e5, on the other hand, are nationally recognized public holidays that the government establishes to honor, commemorate, or celebrate something. Consequently, these days are frequently \u4f11\u65e5 for many people.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u796d\u65e5 may either refer to days when temples carry out festivals or days when the imperial court performs a ceremony. Prior to World War II, such Shinto related festivals were treated as &#8220;holidays&#8221; with this designation.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u795d\u796d\u65e5 is a term meant to refer to both \u795d\u65e5 and \u796d\u65e5.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The holidays recognized in&nbsp;Modern Japan were established in 1948 via the law entitled \u56fd\u6c11\u306e\u795d\u65e5\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u6cd5\u5f8b. This law established holiday start dates as being aligned with the Gregorian calendar, but for most of Japanese history, holidays were&nbsp;determined by the lunisolar calendar. Additionally, with the introduction of a new constitution, &#8216;holidays&#8217; which were originally treated as&nbsp;\u796d\u65e5 were stripped of their religious significance and rebranded as \u795d\u65e5. Nonetheless, although defunct political lingo, speakers still frequently use&nbsp;\u796d\u65e5 and \u795d\u796d\u65e5 in their original contexts, especially when referencing festivals which are still usually organized by local temples.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first provision of the&nbsp;<em>Law Regarding National Holidays<\/em>&nbsp;is as follows:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u7b2c\u4e00\u6761<\/strong>\u3000\u81ea\u7531\u3068\u5e73\u548c\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u3066\u3084\u307e\u306a\u3044\u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u6c11\u306f\u3001\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u98a8\u7fd2\u3092\u80b2\u3066\u3064\u3064\u3001\u3088\u308a\u3088\u304d\u793e\u4f1a\u3001\u3088\u308a\u8c4a\u304b\u306a\u751f\u6d3b\u3092\u7bc9\u304d\u3042\u3052\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001\u3053\u3053\u306b\u56fd\u6c11\u3053\u305e\u3064\u3066\u795d\u3044\u3001\u611f\u8b1d\u3057\u3001\u53c8\u306f\u8a18\u5ff5\u3059\u308b\u65e5\u3092\u5b9a\u3081\u3001\u3053\u308c\u3092\u300c\u56fd\u6c11\u306e\u795d\u65e5\u300d\u3068\u540d\u3065\u3051\u308b\u3002<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Article I: The citizens of Japan, who ceaselessly seek freedom and peace, in order to build an evermore prosperous livelihood and a greater society while instilling beautiful customs, gather here as citizens to celebrate, give thanks, and commemorate these days which are to be named &#8220;Holidays of the People.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second article then lists the holidays recognized under Japanese law, establishes their dates, and gives the reason for why it is a national public holiday.

This time period and the festival and customs associate with it are collectively&nbsp;known as&nbsp;\u6b63\u6708, which traditionally referred to the first month of the lunisolar calendar but has since been moved to the Western month of January ever since the solar Gregorian calendar was implemented in Japan as of 1872 AD. \u6b63\u6708 last four a three-day period known as \u4e09\u304c\u65e5.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u5143\u65e5&nbsp;is also associated with the length of time known as \u677e\u306e\u5185 in which people have a decoration made of pine called \u9580\u677e outside their homes to welcome ancestral spirits back. Legend has it that one&#8217;s ancestors become the kami of the fields and mountains and that on New Year&#8217;s, they become \u6b73\u795e\uff08\u3068\u3057\u304c\u307f\uff09, bringing them prosperity for the New Year. Rituals for the spirits are held with family by cleaning up the home and praying to a household shrine (\u795e\u68da) meant for New Year&#8217;s.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many foods traditionally eaten during New Year celebration. These foods are referred to as \u304a\u7bc0\u6599\u7406. The biggest example of this is a seven-herb rice porridge known as \u4e03\u8349\u7ca5. Other foods that have become popularized to eat at this time include \u304a\u96d1\u716e,&nbsp;&nbsp;soup containing rice cakes and various vegetables, mochi (\u9905), and eating soba noodles on New Year&#8217;s Eve (known as \u5e74\u8d8a\u3057\u854e\u9ea6).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The making of mochi is a common tradition at this time\u649e\u304f. Steamed sticky rice (\u7cef\u7c73) is put into wooden containers (\u81fc) that is then patted with water by one person as another person hits \uff08\u649e\u304f\uff09it with a large wooden mallet (\u6775). A mochi decoration for New Year&#8217;s known as&nbsp;<em>kagami mochi<\/em>&nbsp;(\u93e1\u9905) is made by placing one round mochi cake atop another with a bitter orange (\u6a59) placed on top.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At midnight, Buddhist temples ring their bells a total of 108 times, and the bell itself is known as&nbsp;(\u9664\u591c\u306e\u9418), symbolizing getting rid of the 108 worldly temptations of everyone in the nation. There are various explanations as to why it is 108 rings, but it must be noted that there are temples which ring more than 108 times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first day of the New Year, people go out and do things for the first time. One of the most important duties is one&#8217;s first visit to the shrine (\u521d\u8a63), but if you sleep in and stay home all day, that&#8217;s known as \u5bdd\u6b63\u6708.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>New Year&#8217;s is also when people send out postcards called \u5e74\u8cc0\u72b6 to friends and relatives, but people refrain from sending postcards when a death has occurred in the family during the year. In this event, a family member sends out a mourning postcard known as \u55aa\u4e2d\u8449\u66f8 to inform friends and relatives not to send a New Year&#8217;s card out of respect to the one\/those who have passed away in the family that year. This tradition is waning due to the influence of cellphones and the various social media apps that now exist.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When meeting people right before New Year&#8217;s, people greet by saying \u3088\u3044\u304a\u5e74\u3092. Once the New Year has arrived, people then greet by saying \u3042\u3051\u307e\u3057\u3066\u304a\u3081\u3067\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059. This is somewhat different than the English speaking world, which sums up both phrases with &#8220;Happy New Year.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Coming of Age Day \u6210\u4eba\u306e\u65e5<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6761: \u304a\u3068\u306a\u306b\u306a\u3064\u305f\u3053\u3068\u3092\u81ea\u899a\u3057\u3001\u307f\u305a\u304b\u3089\u751f\u304d\u629c\u3053\u3046\u3068\u3059\u308b\u9752\u5e74\u3092\u795d\u3044\u306f\u3052\u307e\u3059\u3002<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Article II: To congratulate and encourage the youth for becoming self-aware of their adulthood and to live out their lives.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The age of maturity in Japanese culture is 20.

On this day each year, the second Monday of January, coming-of-age ceremonies (\u6210\u4eba\u5f0f) are held by communities to congratulate and encourage those who have reached, or will reach, the age of 20 between April 2nd of the previous year and April 1st of the current year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such coming-of-age ceremonies have been celebrated in Japan since antiquity, and in the past, transitioning into adulthood also coincided with change in dress, which was called \u5143\u670d.&nbsp;This ceremony was called \u5143\u670d\u306e\u5100, and in early modern times, it coincided with \u5c0f\u6b63\u6708 (Little New Year), held on Jan. 15 which is usually in line with the first full moon of the New Year. In fact, Coming of Age Day was once always on Jan. 15 from the time it was officialized in 1948 AD until 2000 AD when its date was changed to the second Monday of January.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In modern society, due to Japan&#8217;s low birth rate and subsequently shrinking percentage of young people, the number of attendees each year has been on a steady decline.

From 1872 AD to 1948 AD, a similar holiday known as \u7d00\u5143\u7bc0&nbsp;was held on the same day, which is the day which is believed to be when Emperor Jinmu acceded the throne in 660 BC. Although nothing spectacular is particularly held to commemorate this holiday, shrines and temples do hold festivals known as \u5efa\u56fd\u796d&nbsp;in honor of this day.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Emperor&#8217;s Birthday\u3000\u5929\u7687\u8a95\u751f\u65e5<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6761: \u5929\u7687\u306e\u8a95\u751f\u65e5\u3092\u795d\u3046\u3002<br><em>Article II: To celebrate the Emperor&#8217;s birthday.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Emperor&#8217;s Birthday celebrates the birthday of the reigning Emperor.

This tradition can be traced back to a similar festival from ancient China known as \u5929\u9577\u7bc0. This name was then inherited to refer to the birthdays of Japanese emperors. The name of the holiday was only changed to \u5929\u7687\u8a95\u751f\u65e5. During the reign of Emperor Akihito from 1989 AD to 2019 AD, this holiday was observed on December 23rd,&nbsp;but because he had abdicated the throne prior to his birthday, this holiday was subsequently not observed in 2019 AD.

Prior to that year, the vernal equinox was honored in Shintoism with what is known as the \u6625\u5b63\u7687\u970a\u796d. However, due to its relation to &#8216;State Shintoism,&#8217; this event in particular was subsequently abolished. Although honoring the dead of the imperial line may not be observed by the national public, this time is still meant to be when people go visit their loved one&#8217;s graves, clean the gravestones (\u304a\u5893\u6383\u9664), and leave offerings of food or flowers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, it is part of a seven-day period known as \u6625\u306e\uff08\u304a\uff09\u5f7c\u5cb8.

They&#8217;re work holidays at best to make up for Japan not having as many specified national holidays as other nations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, the clause which states that the next closest day to a national holiday following on a Sunday establishes holidays known as \u632f\u66ff\u4f11\u65e5, which are substitute national holidays which are in lieu of the national holiday which fell on a Sunday. Many people have Sundays off as their weekend, so it would be disadvantageous to the general populace not to compensate them for this. This provision was enacted in 1973 AD, which ensures a certain number of three-day weekends as well as half of the duration of Golden Week each year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, the last clause to Article III establishes even more &#8216;citizen holidays&#8217; by recognizing any day sandwiched in between national holidays as a holiday. This clause was enacted in 1988 AD, but its implementation is actually rather rare. Although it had ensured&nbsp;that May 4th was a holiday for Golden Week, this clause became void once May 4th was established as a proper national holiday when the date for Greenery Day was changed to that time. Every so often, though, a citizen&#8217;s day will emerge when Respect for the Aged Day and the Autumnal Equinox Day align just right.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The economic impact of Golden Week is immense. Many Japanese citizens use this week to go traveling, and although many choose to travel internationally, local travel increases several fold during this time. Nonetheless, there are many cons that have arisen. Aside from the obvious traffic issues that emerge when people try returning home, many people suffer from lost productivity upon returning to work. This has led to the coining of the phrase \u4e94\u6708\u75c5 to particularly refer to young people who are uncapable of coping with returning to business as usual. Since the COVID pandemic (\u30b3\u30ed\u30ca\u798d), Golden Week has been rebranded&nbsp;by many municipalities as \u30b9\u30c6\u30a4\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af, but how Golden Week will continue to operate moving forward into the 2020s is surely to be a potential source of law revision in the coming years.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Happy Monday System\u3000\u30cf\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30c7\u30fc\u5236\u5ea6<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As could be gleamed from the descriptions of each holiday, several holidays which did not particularly fall on a Monday were moved to Monday through a set of modifications to Japanese law from 1998-2001. The goal of this was to create more three-day weekends to benefit people who have a five-day work week. The holidays affected by this policy are as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Coming of Age Day (since 2000 AD)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Marine Day (since 2003 AD)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Respect for the Aged Day (since 2003 AD)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sports Day (since 2000 AD)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">International Holidays\u3000\u56fd\u969b\u306e\u795d\u796d\u65e5<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The general knowledge of international holidays among the Japanese populace is limited to very well-known holidays or festival-like events. Many that come to mind include Easter (\u30a4\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc), Christmas (\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30de\u30b9), Halloween (\u30cf\u30ed\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30f3), Hanukah (\u30cf\u30cc\u30ab\u30fc), etc. However, it must be noted that because Japanese law doesn&#8217;t recognize any religiously significant day as a holiday, international holidays with religious ties are also not treated as national holidays. So, whether you get Christmas off or not from your company while working in Japan will be left to management&#8217;s discretion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putting legality aside, translations (transliterations at best in most instances) do exist for international holidays. So, if you are working for a Japanese company stationed in a foreign country (foreign referring to not residing in the domestic territory of Japan), you will likely have company provided calendars with both the holidays of Japan and of the host country listed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In Conclusion&#8230; \u6700\u5f8c\u306b\u2026<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This lesson has introduced you to all of the formally recognized national holidays of Japan. In doing so, you were also introduced to prior terminology for holidays which had existed since antiquity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As religiosity has been stripped from the concept of &#8220;holiday&#8221; in Modern Japan, knowing when the famous matsuri festivals occur along with any other event (\u884c\u4e8b) date with any form of religious significance has been completely relinquished to the public sector. As such, living in your Japanese community is the best way to be acquainted with any culturally significant \u796d\u65e5 that may exist in that locality.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, although New Year&#8217;s Eve (\u5927\u6666\u65e5) is just as important in Japan as it is in the West, the events that occur on that date in Japan are heavily tied to religious tradition. As a result, only New Year&#8217;s Day (\u5143\u65e5) is federally recognized.
