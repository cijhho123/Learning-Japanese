Rather, you would still need to say \u72ec\u308a\u5584\u304c\u308a\u306a\u4eba.&nbsp;2. Of these phrases, \u5f31\u304c\u308a would be the least used. At first glance, it would seem to be synonymous with \u5f31\u866b, but the difference is that the former implies the person is feigning said behavior. Few people would behave this way on person, and so the word is as rare as is the phenomenon it reflects.&nbsp;3. The use \uff5e\u305f\u304c\u308a is very productive in coining endless amounts of phrases. Minus a few common examples, most examples of this will be off-shoot phrases that people spontaneously think of to describe someone.&nbsp;4. As a recap from earlier, the phrases in this chart are marked with \u25b3 when they are rare and not because they are inherently incorrect. Some phrases are realistically far more common than others, and this has a major effect on the recognition native speakers have toward the lesser common ones.&nbsp;5. These phrases are all technically synonymous with \uff5e\u304c\u308b being used as an attribute in the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62. For example, \u9762\u5012\u304f\u3055\u304c\u308b\u4eba is just as valid as \u9762\u5012\u304f\u3055\u304c\u308a\u306a\u4eba grammatically. The difference is that the former would just describe the state of the person\u2019s behavior whereas the latter describes inherent personality.<br>6.

Because \uff5e\u304c\u308b cannot attach to verbs, \u597d\u304d\u304c\u308b is not possible. Perhaps in the feature of the verb form were to disappear, this form may appear, but in today\u2019s speech, other grammar points are needed to express third person likes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the others that were listed as impossible combinations, \u8efd\u304c\u308b would also seem to be one that should be possible, but the reason for it is not is because it actually exists from a completely separate phenomenon. The word \u8efd\u3005 is created from a repetition of the root, resulting in an adverb that means \u201ccarelessly.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When You Can\u2019t Use&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>\uff5e\u304c\u308b<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we have learned in this lesson, \uff5e\u304c\u308b is only used in a very limited pool of expressions. These expressions all demonstrate particular feelings\/behaviors, and it is that it should be known for rather than a third person emotional state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From all this coverage, there is still one question that remains.
