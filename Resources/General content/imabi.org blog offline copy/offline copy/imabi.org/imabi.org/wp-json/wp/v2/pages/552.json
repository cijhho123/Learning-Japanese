We ask for your cooperation in having 2 mothers accompany every 10 children!<br><br>The visualization of this scenario is that the kids are being grouped from start to finish in groups of 10, and for each group of 10, a group made up of 2 mothers is assigned. Group A = the kids, and Group B = the mothers. We can then rationalize this as a ratio: &#8220;A:B.&#8221; So far, so good, but next, let&#8217;s assign the numbers a designation. For the number that accompanies Group A, we will refer to it as #<sub>\u7532<\/sub>, and for the number that accompanies Group B, we will refer to it as #<sub>\u4e59<\/sub>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In both English and Japanese, it is more common for one to say &#8220;give # (B) to each (A=1<sub>\u7532<\/sub>)&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;give # (B) to (A=2<sup>(+)<\/sup><sub>\u7532<\/sub>).&#8221; Simply put, the most common ratios are those in which Group A = 1. In the following example, 2a demonstrates how such a ratio is expressed with \u305a\u3064, and 2b shows how one might paraphrase \u305a\u3064 out while still saying essentially the same thing. <br><br>2a. \u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u3072\u3068\u308a\uff11\uff10\u679a\u305a\u3064\u3067\u3059\u3088\u3002<br>2b. \u3072\u3068\u308a\u3042\u305f\u308a\uff11\uff10\u679a\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3001\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u914d\u3063\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002<br><br>Interestingly enough, while 2a does present itself as the most succinct means of writing the ratio 1:10, similar sentences cause headaches to learners and instructors alike when [A=1] is not so blatantly apparent, which is to say, what can constitute to A is not limited to nouns or counter phrases restricted to the number 1 so long as one entity is the result. With that said, consider 3a and its paraphrasing 3b.  <br><br>3a. \u6559\u79d1\u66f8\u306f2\u518a\u305a\u3064\u3001\u5c0f\u8aac\u306f5\u518a\u305a\u3064\u3001\u96d1\u8a8c\u306f5\u518a\u305a\u3064\u3001\uff13\u672c\u306e\u7d10\u3067\u62ec\u3063\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002<br>3b. \uff11\u62ec\u308a\u306b\u3064\u304d\u3001\u6559\u79d1\u66f8\u304c2\u518a\u3001\u5c0f\u8aac\u304c5\u518a\u3001\u96d1\u8a8c\u304c5\u518a\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u30013\u672c\u306e\u7d10\u3067\u7e1b\u3063\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002<br>3a. Please tie together two textbooks, five novels, and five magazines with three pieces of string (in each bundle). <br>3b. Please tie them with three strings so that each bundle contains two textbooks, five novels, and five magazines.<br><br>From the translations, we can deduce that the A in [A=1] is a bundle. That bundle is comprised of [\uff13\u672c\u306e\u7d10], but the appearance of &#8220;3&#8221; within A does not affect how this ratio functions, nor does there being multiple components to B affect it. This can all be rationalized with some math: A[<sub>n parts<\/sub>]: B[<sub>n parts<\/sub>]. If anything, the repetition of the particle \u305a\u3064 helps make it abundantly clear that the speaker is extending the range of B. The last source of confusion for a learner is that ratios are not always verbalized in the rigid order A:B like a mathematician may like. In 3a, B is stated first, and with A having a number inside it, despite still equating to 1, this does complicate the sentence as far as word order is concerned. However, \u305a\u3064 ALWAYS marks the B in a ratio, so whether or not A is stated first, that fact is the one constant you should look out for. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While in many instances, B constitutes a direct object, and A constitutes an indirect object, this is not always the case. In Ex. 4, A is actually the direct object, and B is marked with the particle \u3067 to indicate means, as the allocation of B to A actually constitutes [A=1]. <br><br>4a. \u307e\u305a\uff18\u4eba\u305a\u3064\u3067\u8f2a\u3092\u3064\u304f\u3063\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002<br>4b. \u3072\u3068\u3064\u306e\u8f2a\u304c\u3001\uff18\u4eba\u304b\u3089\u3067\u304d\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3001\u8f2a\u3092\u3064\u304f\u3063\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002<br><br>Oddly enough, in actual conversation, when both A and B = 1, we find that A is often emphatically repeated, as if to say the simplest ratio is likely the very ratio someone might mess up in execution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. \u3053\u306e\uff12\uff10\u518a\u306e\u96d1\u8a8c\u3092\u3072\u3068\u308a\u3072\u3068\u308a\u306b\u4e00\u518a\u305a\u3064\u914d\u3063\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002<br>Please pass out to each and every person one of these twenty magazines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also the issue of implied A components and how A might manifest temporally, which again, other numbers may be involved, but each interval would still constitute as 1 interval.
