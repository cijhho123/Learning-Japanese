For instance, \u96e8 meaning &#8220;rain&#8221; is \u3042\u3081 as a standalone noun, but it manifests as \u3042\u307e in compounds such as \u96e8\u96f2\uff08\u3042\u307e\u3050\u3082\uff09. This lesson will try to shed led on how exactly these alternating forms work. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u9732\u51fa\u5f62 &amp; \u88ab\u8986\u5f62<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To begin, let&#8217;s consider the word \u767d\u7389, which is read as \u3057\u3089\u305f\u307e.
