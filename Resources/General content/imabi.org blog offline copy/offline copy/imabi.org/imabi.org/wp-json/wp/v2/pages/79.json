In Japanese, the <strong>copula verb<\/strong> is highly versatile and frequently used. By mastering this single grammar point, you will be able to start forming sentences right away. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we begin, to help you navigate this chapter more easily, let\u2019s first cover some basic grammar terminology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Subject:&nbsp;<\/strong><em>The person\/thing that performs the action or exhibits the description found in the predicate.<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Predicate<\/strong>:&nbsp;<em>The part of a sentence that makes a statement about the subject.&nbsp;<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Copula<\/strong>:&nbsp;<em>A word used to link the subject and predicate of a sentence.<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Noun<\/strong>:&nbsp;<em>In its most basic definition, a word that refers to a person, place, thing, event, substance, or quality.&nbsp;<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Auxiliary<\/strong>:&nbsp;<em>An ending that helps construct verbal conjugations.<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Plain Speech<\/strong>:<em>&nbsp;Refers to the entire plain speech register in Japanese grammar.<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Plain Style<\/strong><em>: Is the plain speech rendition of any given phrase.<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Plain Form<\/strong>:<em> The basic form of any given phrase.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Forms of &#8220;To Be&#8221; in English<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In English, the copula verb is \u201cto be,\u201d and it manifests itself in various forms such as &#8220;am,&#8221; &#8220;are,&#8221; &#8220;is,&#8221; &#8220;was, &#8220;were,&#8221; etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>i. The dog <strong>is<\/strong> a German shepherd.<br>ii. I <strong>am<\/strong> a banker.<br>iii. That <strong>was<\/strong> a<strong> <\/strong>fruit.<br>iv. They <strong>were<\/strong> not fossils.<br>v. Bats <strong>are<\/strong> not birds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, the Japanese copula verb \u3060 also has various forms, but its conjugations differ significantly from those in English. This is especially evident when it comes to tense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tense<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In English, there are three primary tenses:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Past tense<\/strong>: Refers to an event or state that occurred in the past.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Present tense<\/strong>: Refers to a current event or state.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Future tense<\/strong>: Refers to an event or state that has yet to occur.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>While Japanese does conjugate for tense, it does so very differently. Overall, tense distinctions are more context-dependent. This can largely be attributed to how Japanese only has two primary tenses: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Non-past tense<\/strong>: Refers to an ongoing event or state or one that has yet to occur. <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Past tense<\/strong>: Refers to an event or state that occurred in the past.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Affirmation and Negation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another dynamic that affects how conjugation differs between English and Japanese is how affirmation and negation are handled. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Affirmative sentence<\/strong>: A sentence that positively states that the premise (predicate) is the case.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Negative sentence<\/strong>: A sentence that rejects the premise (predicate).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Introducing Japanese Conjugation w\/\u3060<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The copula verb \u3060 will be your first encounter with a conjugatable part of speech and Japanese, and what you will learn in this lesson will serve as an introduction to how Japanese&#8217;s base-ending conjugation system works.<br><br>The following terms will be used throughout this lesson and in future discussions on how to conjugate:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Base<\/strong>:<em>&nbsp;One of the six forms that a conjugable part of speech (verb, adjective, auxiliary verb, etc.) may take which is then followed by endings (auxiliaries, etc.).&nbsp;<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Terminal\/Predicative Form<\/strong>:&nbsp;<em>Known in Japanese as the&nbsp;<\/em><strong>\u7d42\u6b62\u5f62<\/strong><em>,<\/em><strong><em>&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><em>it marks the end of a complete sentence\/the predicate.&nbsp;<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Attributive Form<\/strong>:&nbsp;<em>Known in Japanese as the&nbsp;<\/em><strong>\u9023\u4f53\u5f62<\/strong><em>, it is used to make a verb, adjective, etc. into a modifier that goes directly before a noun.&nbsp;<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Basic Form<\/strong>: <em>The basic form of any given phrase, in other words, is utilized in plain speech as well as in many grammatical circumstances.

As a result, &#8220;X is Y&#8221; cannot be rendered as &#8220;X\u3060Y.&#8221; To create a grammatically sound sentence using \u3060, the correct pattern is X\u306fY\u3060<sup data-fn=\"3db61bca-825d-4e01-b714-32fd8a9b2e39\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#3db61bca-825d-4e01-b714-32fd8a9b2e39\" id=\"3db61bca-825d-4e01-b714-32fd8a9b2e39-link\">2<\/a><\/sup>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u306f\u98f2\u307f\u7269\u3060\u3002<br>Coffee is a drink.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, we see that the structure starts off with the subject (X) marked as the topic of discussion by the particle \u306f (\u2192 <a href=\"https:\/\/imabi.org\/the-particle-wa-%e3%81%af-i-the-topic-contrast-marker\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"85\">Lesson 13<\/a>), followed by the predicate (Y).

The context will definitely make the interpretation obvious, with time phrases such as &#8220;tomorrow&#8221; being important for deciphering. As for determining how \u3060 should be interpreted, though, its non-past form (Exs. 2-8) is usually interpreted as being in the present tense, with its future tense (Exs. 9-12) interpretation limited to specific contexts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In these examples, \u3060 is in its &#8220;predicative form,&#8221; appearing at the end of the sentence and constitutes the <a href=\"https:\/\/imabi.org\/glossary\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"3307\">main clause (\u4e3b\u7bc0)<\/a> of the sentence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Non-Past = Present Tense<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u3042\u308c\u306f\u5bfa\u3060\u3002<br>That over there is a Buddhist temple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u305d\u308c\u306f\u5618\u3060\u3002<br>That is&nbsp;a lie.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u3053\u308c\u306f\u4e8b\u5b9f\u3060\u3002<br>This is the truth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. \u3042\u306e\u65b0\u4eba\u306f\u5927\u5b66\u751f\u3060\u3002<br>That newcomer is a college student.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. \u3042\u306e\u4eba\u306f\u97d3\u56fd\u4eba\u3060\u3002<br>That person is Korean.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. \u66f8\u9053\u306f\u82b8\u8853\u3060\u3002<br>Calligraphy is art.<br><br>8. \u5f7c\u306f\u30d0\u30ab\u3060\u3002<br>He is an idiot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One notable observation from these examples is that \u3060 conveys a very direct tone. While this level of directness is more common in written Japanese, it is less frequently heard in spoken conversation, particularly when discussing interpersonal matters. In fact, in conversations where one might use examples like Ex. 5 or Ex. 6, it is often more natural to omit \u3060 altogether; this subtle adjustment reflects the more implicit and less direct style of spoken Japanese (see below).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Non-Past = Future Tense<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As can be deduced from these examples, English also exhibits fluctuation between &#8220;is&#8221; and &#8220;will be&#8221; in the same contexts in which \u3060 can be viewed as either or in its non-past form, particularly when referring to established dates, which are incidentally also &#8220;future&#8221; events. This parallels how \u3060 encompasses both the present and future tense in Japanese.<br><br>9. \u5143\u65e5\u306f\u6708\u66dc\u65e5\u3060\u3002<br>New Year\u2019s Day [is\/will be] on Monday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10. \u958b\u59cb\u65e5\u306f\u660e\u65e5\u3060\u3002<br>The start date [is\/will be] tomorrow.<br><br>11. \u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u306f\u591c\u3060\u3002<br>The party&nbsp;[is\/will be] at night.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One situation in which the future tense interpretation of \u3060 is obligatory is when a time phrase that only pertains to the future is used. <br><br>12. \u660e\u65e5\u306f\u96e8\u3060\u3002<br>It will rain tomorrow.<sup data-fn=\"adaabc06-ebc5-4b1a-a39f-44806c21ed3a\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#adaabc06-ebc5-4b1a-a39f-44806c21ed3a\" id=\"adaabc06-ebc5-4b1a-a39f-44806c21ed3a-link\">4<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Omitting X\u306f<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Omitting X\u306f from the pattern X\u306fY\u3060 is incredibly common. This is especially the case when the subject of the corresponding English sentence is the often meaningless pronoun &#8220;it.&#8221; <br><br>13. \u660e\u65e5\u3060\u3002<br>[It\u2019s\/it&#8217;ll be] tomorrow.<br><br>14. \u3042\u3001\u732b\u3060\uff01<br>Ah, (it\u2019s) a cat!<br><br>15. \u6642\u9593\u3060\u3002<br>(It\u2019s) time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In each of these sentences, &#8220;it&#8221; functions as a placeholder for the grammatical subject. As Japanese does not necessitate that X always be overtly present in a sentence, no such word exists for that same function. Instead, if X is to be used in Japanese, it must be a regular noun or pronoun. Luckily, if &#8220;it&#8221; appears in the same capacity as seen in Exs. 13-15 in English, it will correspond to nothing in Japanese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Omitting \u3060 in Exclamations<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As has been stated, the copula \u3060 itself may be dropped from the pattern X\u306fY to avoid sounding too direct, even in the context of conversation had in plain speech. The presence of \u3060 often creates a direct, firm, and at at times, a more masculine tone. <br><br>Another common context for omitting \u3060 is in exclamatory sentences. In such cases, even the copula verb is often omitted in English. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>16. \u3042\u3001\u30d4\u30ab\u30c1\u30e5\u30a6\uff08\u3060\uff09\uff01<br>Ah, (it\u2019s) (a) Pikachu!<br><br>17. \u958b\u59cb\uff08\u3060\uff09\uff01<br>Start!<br><br>18. \u52d5\u7269\u5712\uff08\u3060\uff09\uff01<br>(It\u2019s) [a\/the] zoo!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>19. \u5f15\u304d\u5206\u3051\uff08\u3060\uff09\uff01<br>(It\u2019s a) draw!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>20. \u3042\u3001\u30ab\u30ef\u30a6\u30bd\uff08\u3060\uff09\uff01<br>Ah, (it\u2019s) an otter!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Past Tense\u3000<br>\u904e\u53bb\u5f62<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The past tense form (\u904e\u53bb\u5f62) is created by adding the auxiliary verb \uff5e\u305f to the continuative form (\u9023\u7528\u5f62) of a conjugatable part of speech. In the case of the copula verb \u3060, its continuative form is \u3060\u3063, resulting in \u3060\u3063\u305f. The continuative form is used in this construction because of how it pertains to <em>things (being) carried out<\/em>, which includes situations that are already over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table aligncenter\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Form<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Conjugation<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Base<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Auxiliary<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Non-Past<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u3060<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u3060 (predicative)<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">n\/a<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Past<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u3060\u3063\u305f<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u3060\u3063 (continuative)<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\uff5e\u305f<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>21. \u3055\u3063\u304d\u306e\u8a00\u8a9e\u306f\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u8a9e\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>The language just now was French.<br><br>22. \u3053\u3053\u306f\u5b66\u6821\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>This here was a school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>23. \u6b63\u89e3\u306fA\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>The correct answer was A.<br><br>24. \u6628\u65e5\u306f\u6c34\u66dc\u65e5\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>Yesterday was Wednesday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>25. \u5f7c\u306f\u5b50\u4f9b\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>He was a child.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Negative Form\u3000<br>\u5426\u5b9a\u5f62<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The negative (non-past) form (\u5426\u5b9a\u5f62) of the copula verb \u3060 is \u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044, which translates into English as &#8220;is\/am\/are not.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this structure:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The continuative form of \u3060 becomes \u3067.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The negative auxiliary \uff5e\u306a\u3044 (not) is added, forming \u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that \u3067 here differs from the continuative form \u3060\u3063 used for the past tense.
