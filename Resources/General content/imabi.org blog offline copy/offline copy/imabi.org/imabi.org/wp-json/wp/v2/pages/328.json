As its primary meaning is &#8220;to be strict,&#8221;&nbsp; when it does mean &#8220;hard\/tough\/difficult&#8221; situations, it&#8217;s implied that a halfhearted attempt would not be tolerable.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9. \u8c61\u5fb4\u5929\u7687\u5236\u3092\u652f\u3048\u308b\u7687\u5ba4\u306e\u524d\u9014\u306f\u975e\u5e38\u306b<strong>\u53b3\u3057\u3044<\/strong>\u3002<br>The outlook of an Imperial Household, which sustains the symbolic emperor system (of Japan), is very bleak.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10. \u5149\u5700\u306f\u8868\u60c5\u3092<strong>\u53b3\u3057\u304f<\/strong>\u3057\u3066\u306b\u3058\u308a\u5bc4\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>Mitsukuni had a grim expression on his face as he inched toward (him).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As is the case with most native vocabulary, \u96e3\u3057\u3044 does have a Sino-Japanese equivalent.

This word can be used both as a standalone noun meaning &#8220;difficulty\/hardship&#8221; as well as an adjectival noun meaning &#8220;difficult&#8221; in the sense of a situation being extremely difficult. Thus, its meaning is quite narrow in comparison to \u96e3\u3057\u3044. Additionally, it has its own synonym, which is \u96e3\u5100. \u96e3\u5100 implies a greater degree of emotional trauma surrounding the difficult situation. However, in many areas of Japan, it is often used entirely synonymously with both \u96e3\u3057\u3044 and \u56f0\u96e3.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11.&nbsp;<strong>\u56f0\u96e3<\/strong>\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u8d8a\u3048\u305f\u7d4c\u9a13\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u6559\u3048\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002<br>Please tell us of an experience where you overcame hardship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u7761\u7720\u6642\u9593\u306e\u57fa\u6e96\u3092\u5b9a\u3081\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u4e0d\u8db3\u3067<strong>\u56f0\u96e3<\/strong><strong>\u3060<\/strong>\u3002<br>Determining a standard for necessary&nbsp;number of hours of sleep is difficult due to lack of data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13.&nbsp;<strong>\u96e3\u5100\u3084<\/strong>\u306a\u3042\u3002\uff08\u95a2\u897f\u5f01\uff09<br>This is sure tough.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Phrase Note<\/strong>: Ex. 13 is a very common expression throughout the Kansai Region of Japan, but it has also been popularized throughout the country, especially given that the word \u96e3\u5100 does, in fact, exist in Standard Japanese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also intriguing to note that both \u56f0\u96e3\u3059\u308b and&nbsp;\u96e3\u5100\u3059\u308b mean&nbsp;&#8220;to suffer,&#8221; in which case both would be more creative\/literary ways of saying \u82e6\u3057\u307f\u60a9\u3080&#8211;excluding the dialectal favoring of \u96e3\u5100 in some regions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14. \u5bbf\u6cca\u696d\u3082\u5927\u5909<strong>\u56f0\u96e3\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b<\/strong>\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002<br>The hotel industry is also surely suffering terribly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>15. \u3048\u3089\u3044<strong>\u96e3\u5100\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f<\/strong>\u3002\uff08\u4eac\u90fd\u5f01\uff09<br>I had a hard time of things.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Returning our focus to&nbsp;\u96e3\u3057\u3044, it&#8217;s important to note two alternative forms of the same word.
