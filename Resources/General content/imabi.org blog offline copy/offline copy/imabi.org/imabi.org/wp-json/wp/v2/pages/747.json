As you know, \u3066 follows the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 as a conjunctive particle to show continuation or parallelism. It has become so important that it is deemed an essential conjugation in Japanese, the \u3066\u5f62, or more correctly called the \u4e26\u5217\u5f62 in this instance. Essentially how it works is that it attaches to the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 and stops the continuation of the current clause, and you as the listener or reader expect something related to that clause to be said next.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about \uff5e\u3066\u306e? \u306e makes an attribute. You may have seen \uff5e\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e (about) before.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1a. \u65e5\u672c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u8a71\u3059\u3002To talk about Japan.<br>1b. \u65e5\u672c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u8a71\u3002 A talk about Japan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second it&#8217;s used as an attribute of \u8a71. There are several such phrases and they&#8217;re often deemed as fixed postpositions. This, though, doesn&#8217;t account for everything. In reality there are four broad usages of \uff5e\u3066\u306e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. The attribute form for stopping the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 (\u9023\u7528\u4e2d\u6b62\u6cd5\u306e\u9023\u4f53\u5f62).<br>2. As a postposition (the opposite of a preposition)<br>3. In fixed attribute expressions.&nbsp;<br>4. After \u3066 phrases used adverbially like \u521d\u3081\u3066.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the hard one is 1. Expressions under the third category are just deemed suffixes. An example is \uff5e\u304d\u3063\u3066\u306e (The most&#8230;of all).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u56fd\u5185\u304d\u3063\u3066\u306e\u654f\u8155\u5bb6<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The most capable person in the country<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also understand expressions under 4 like \u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u751f\u307e\u308c\u3066\u521d\u3081\u3066\u306e\u6d77\u5916\u65c5\u884c\u306f\u30e1\u30ad\u30b7\u30b3\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; My first overseas trip ever was to Mexico.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is how \u306e really functions and the relationship between the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 and \u9023\u4f53\u5f62. Say you have the verb \u4f7f\u3046. \u4f7f\u3046\u2019s \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 is still just \u4f7f\u3046. So, why can you say something like \u3055\u3044\u3053\u308d\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u306e\u904a\u3073 (a game played with dice)? One would assume that this could work with anything. However, there are indeed instances where this is unnatural. Now we have to find out what these restrictions are. The previous example could have easily been stated as \u3055\u3044\u3053\u308d\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u904a\u3073.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\uff5e\u3066\u306e has a deep tie to the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62. After all, it too is an attributive expression. Considering the ways to make an attributive expression in Japanese, you have the following options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"1\">\n<li>Nominal + \u306e \uff0b Noun (<ruby>\u6728<rt>\u3053<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e<ruby>\u8449<rt>\u306f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3000\uff1d\u3000tree leaves)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u9023\u4f53\u5f62\u3000\uff0b Noun\u3000\u3000(\u304d\u308c\u3044\u306a\u753a;&nbsp;\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u82b1;&nbsp;\u52c9\u5f37\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b<ruby>\u751f\u5f92<rt>\u305b\u3044\u3068<\/rt><\/ruby>&nbsp;\uff09<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Attributive\u3000(\u3053\u306e\u5b66\u6821)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us not forget about the underlining properties of an attribute and case particles themselves as we examine this pattern further.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4a. \u97d3\u56fd\u3078\u65c5\u884c\u3059\u308b\u3002To travel to Korea.<br>4b. \u97d3\u56fd\u3078\u306e\u65c5\u884c\u3002 Travel to Korea.<br>4c. \u97d3\u56fd\u306b\u306e\u65c5\u884c\u3002X&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, you have to use \u306e for the attribute, and the case particle in this case stays. However, you couldn&#8217;t have said \u306b\u306e. Consider how the following expressions below change when you change it to an attribute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. \u9ad8\u6821<strong>\u3092<\/strong>\u5352\u696d\u3059\u308b\u3000\u2192\u3000\u9ad8\u6821<strong>\u306e<\/strong>\u5352\u696d<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; To graduate high school\u3000\u2192\u3000High school graduation<br><br>6. \u5f7c<strong>\u306b<\/strong>\u6b7b\u5211<strong>\u3092<\/strong>\u5ba3\u544a\u3059\u308b\u3000\u2192\u3000\u5f7c<strong>\u3078\u306e<\/strong>\u6b7b\u5211<strong>\u306e<\/strong>\u5ba3\u544a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; To give him the death penalty\u3000\u2192 The death sentence given to him<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. \u6b66\u5668<strong>\u304c<\/strong>\u6050\u308d\u3057<strong>\u3044<\/strong>\u3000\u2192\u3000\u6b66\u5668<strong>\u3078\u306e<\/strong>\u6050\u308d\u3057<strong>\u3055<\/strong><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Weapons are dreadful\u3000\u2192\u3000The dreadfulness of weapons<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; What about when it seems that both the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 and the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 are logical choices. These are exceptional circumstances, and the noun in question is one that has adjectival qualities. Consider the following.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8a. \u5f7c\u5973\u306f\u3059\u3054\u304f\u7f8e\u4eba\u3060\u3002<br>8b. \u5f7c\u5973\u306f\u3059\u3054\u3044\u7f8e\u4eba\u3060\u3002(\u5143\u306f\u9593\u9055\u3044)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first focuses on the quality of beauty while the second modifies the thing. So, it&#8217;s like the difference between &#8220;she&#8217;s really beautiful&#8221; and &#8220;she&#8217;s a real beauty&#8221;. In other cases such as the ones we&#8217;ve seen, there is a clear back-and-forth change between the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 and \u9023\u4f53\u5f62. However, sometimes changing one phrase to fit the other results in an unnatural sentence. This is due to semantic restraints, not the &#8216;grammaticality&#8217; of the phrase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9. \u3046\u308c\u3057\u3044\u8a71\u3000\u3007\u3000\u2192\u3000\u3046\u308c\u3057\u304f\u8a71\u3059\u3000X &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about adverbs? What if they&#8217;re used like an attribute? \u306f\u3058\u3081\u3066 is a prime example of \u306e following. \u3057\u3070\u3089\u304f (in a while) is also a good example. Yet, there is a group of adverbs that never take \u306e even when they are with a noun. These nouns are relative and have to do with an indeterminate quantity. So, one says something like \u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u524d. However, \u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u306e\u524d is unacceptable. There are still other adverbs that are never used with \u306e like \u5fc5\u305a.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have now gotten a glimpse of why \uff5e\u3066\u306e may be so difficult given the complexity of the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 itself and how it relates to the \u9023\u7528\u5f62.
