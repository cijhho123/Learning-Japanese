In 1981 when the \u5f53\u7528\u6f22\u5b57 list was replaced with the \u5e38\u7528\u6f22\u5b57, a handful of characters had their existing \u7565\u5b57 recognized officially.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td><strong>\u65e7\u5b57\u4f53<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>\u65b0\u305f\u306b\u63a1\u7528\u3055\u308c\u305f\u7565\u5b57\u4f53<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>\u65e7\u5b57\u4f53<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;\u65b0\u305f\u306b\u63a1\u7528\u3055\u308c\u305f\u7565\u5b57\u4f53<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\u9f8d<\/td><td>\u7adc<\/td><td>\u7f50<\/td><td>\u7f36<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u71c8<\/td><td>\u706f<\/td><td>\u87a2<\/td><td>\u86cd<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting in 1955, \u671d\u65e5\u65b0\u805e took it upon itself to fully implement the same simplification patterns for the \u5f53\u7528\u6f22\u5b57 with most\u00a0other Kanji. These character forms became known as \u671d\u65e5\u6587\u5b57\u30fb\u671d\u65e5\u5b57\u4f53. The newspaper reformatted approximately 4,000 Kanji. By the 1980s when the need for establishing glyphs in word processors became essential, several were adopted into mainstream typing, all of which examples remain today, and for the lucky Kanji which were adopted as\u00a0\u5e38\u7528\u6f22\u5b57 in 2010, those simplifications became officially recognized as proper variants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td><strong>\u6b63\u5b57\u4f53<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;\u671d\u65e5\u5b57\u4f53<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;\u6b63\u5b57\u4f53<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;\u671d\u65e5\u5b57\u4f53<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\u75d9<\/td><td>\ud86d\udfac<\/td><td>\u4ff1<\/td><td><strong>\u5036<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u6bb2<\/td><td>\ud86d\udf94<\/td><td>\u4fe0\u00a0<\/td><td><strong>\u4fa0<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u5118<\/td><td><strong>\u4fad<\/strong><\/td><td>\u5005<\/td><td><strong>\u4f1c<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u203b\u4f1c had existed since the \u660e\u6cbb\u6642\u4ee3, so it is not necessarily an \u671d\u65e5\u6587\u5b57 strictly speaking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u203bExamples in bold are frequently used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even for those that are still commonly used, it is not a guarantee that such simplifications will display properly in all fonts or on all systems.

For instance, the radical\u00a0\u8fb6 (movement) had one of its strokes removed in general use Kanji, but the original stroke count was preserved for all other Kanji. Affected Kanji include the following: \u8fbf\u30fb\u8fbb\u30fb\u8fb7\u30fb\u8fda\u30fb\u8fe6\u30fb\u9059<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, more characters utilizing this radical have been designated as general use Kanji, which has led to both the simplified and the non-simplified form of the radical being used interchangeably.
