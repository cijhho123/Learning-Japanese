If A and B form a pair of coexisting phenomena, it is still natural to translate the sentence as an &#8220;if&#8221; statement. If, however, A and B constitute examples about a topic, &#8220;and&#8221; tends to be the simplest and most natural means of translating. This should not take away, though, from how A and B complement each other.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>24. \u4eba\u9593\u3063\u3066\u57fa\u672c\u3001\u96d1\u98df\u3060\u304b\u3089\u3001\u8089\u3082\u98df\u3048\u3070\u91ce\u83dc\u3082\u98df\u3046\u3002\u2462<br>People are generally omnivores, so (we) eat meat and\u00a0vegetables.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: Transitive predicates for A&nbsp;and B allow for X and Y to be objects as seen here in Ex. 30.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>25. \u96e8\u3082\u964d\u308c\u3070\u98a8\u3082\u5439\u304f\u3002\u2460<br>If it&#8217;s raining, the wind is also\u00a0blowing.<br><br>26. \u7537\u3082\u3044\u308c\u3070\u3001\u5973\u3082\u3044\u308b\u3002\u2460<br>If there are men, there are also women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: Predicate A and Predicate B can still be the same word.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>27. \u98df\u3079\u308b\u7269\u3082\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u3001\u4f4f\u3080\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3082\u306a\u3044\u3002\u2460<br>If there isn&#8217;t anything to eat, there won&#8217;t be anywhere to live.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>28. \u4eba\u751f\u306f\u697d\u3057\u3044\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3042\u308c\u3070\u82e6\u3057\u3044\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002\u2461<br>In life, there are both fun times and hardships.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>29. \u6b4c\u3082\u4e0a\u624b\u306a\u3089\u8e0a\u308a\u3082\u3046\u307e\u3044\u3002\u2462<br>&nbsp;(They&#8217;re) good at singing and dancing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>30. \u7d0d\u8c46\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u4eba\u3082\u3044\u308c\u3070\u5acc\u3044\u306a\u4eba\u3082\u3044\u308b\u3067\u3057\u3087\uff1f\u2460<br>If there are&nbsp;people who like natto, then there are also people who don&#8217;t, right?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>31.&nbsp;&nbsp;\u81ea\u8eab\u306f\u30bf\u30d0\u30b3\u3082\u5438\u3048\u3070\u304a\u9152\u3082\u98f2\u3080\u304c\u3001\u5897\u7a0e\u3082\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3042\u308c\u3070\u4ed5\u65b9\u306a\u3044\u3068\u8003\u3048\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u2462<br>As for myself, I smoke and drink, so if a tax increase is necessary, I think that&#8217;s unavoidable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>32. \u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30e8\u30fc\u30af\u306a\u3069\u306f\u6cbb\u5b89\u3082\u60aa\u3051\u308c\u3070\u5bb6\u8cc3\u306a\u3069\u7269\u4fa1\u3082\u9ad8\u3044\u3002\u2461<br>As for New York and other places, public safety is bad and rent\/commodities are expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>33. \u5144\u306f\u548c\u98df\u3082\u4f5c\u308c\u308c\u3070\u6d0b\u98df\u3082\u4f5c\u308c\u308b\u3002\u2462<br>My older brother can prepare Japanese cuisine and Western cuisine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>34. \u3042\u306e\u7537\u306f\u3001\u982d\u3082\u3088\u3051\u308c\u3070\u904b\u52d5\u80fd\u529b\u306b\u3082\u3059\u3050\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u2461<br>That man is smart and superior in athletic ability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>35. \u3053\u306e\u753a\u306f\u6620\u753b\u9928\u3082\u3042\u308c\u3070\u767e\u8ca8\u5e97\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002\u2462<br>This town has a movie theatres and even a department store.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">X\u3082A\u3070B<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In our second lesson on \u3082, we learned a lot about how it is used with quantities.
