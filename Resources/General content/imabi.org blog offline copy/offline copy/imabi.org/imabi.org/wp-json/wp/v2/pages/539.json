Type I \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b predicates do not exhibit overt agents, although agency is inherently implied. Type II \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b predicates, which were only briefly discussed, do exhibit overt agents. The role that \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b plays differs between these two types on the grounds of how the change is perceived (and for what purpose).<br><br>Japanese resources aimed at beginners sometimes claim that Type II sentences are incorrect due to how difficult it is for learners to replicate them correctly as well as distinguish these predicates from those of Type I. This is largely due to there being no true fine line between which verbs can and cannot be used with them, although there are strong tendencies and other grammatical factors that can be used to better distinguish them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Type II: \uff0bAgent w\/ \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Type I \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b predicates are far more statistically common than those of Type II, that does not discredit the grammar behind the latter. To the contrary, it demands that we take a further look into how aspect, agency, and sentence structures all culminate to make both types possible.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, Type II \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b predicates are described as expressing premeditated preparation for a certain outcome and\/or the accumulated result of some action, and this is believed to stem from how Type I \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b predicates may also indicate preparations of some sort having been accomplished.<br><br>1. \u88dc\u4f50\u4eba\u306b\u3082\u53e3\u6b62\u3081\u3057\u3066\u3042\u308b\u3002(Type I)<br>Even the aides have been hushed.<br><br>2. \uff08\u4e8b\u60c5\u3092\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u5168\u54e1\u306b\uff09\u53e3\u6b62\u3081\uff08\u3092\uff09\u3057\u3066\u3042\u308b\u304b\u3089\u3068\u3044\u3063\u3066\u5642\u304c\u5e83\u307e\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3068\u306f\u9650\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3002(Type II)<br>Just because (you) have hushed (everyone involved) doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean rumors won&#8217;t spread.<br><br>In Ex. 2, unlike in Ex. 1, the agent is clear in context, though the tendency to drop agents from a sentence in general still holds true for it being second person. <br><br>In Lesson 37, this premeditated preparation was described indirectly by how the action involved is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">effective in bringing about some goal<\/span>, but it could also still be the case that said result brought about is still ongoing, thus an &#8216;accumulating effect&#8217; that the agent ensured. <br><br>3. \u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093\u3001\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c\u306e\u8abf\u6574\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>Of course, I&#8217;ve made each individual adjustment. <br><br>4. \u4f0a\u85e4\u3055\u3093\u306b\u6765\u6708\u306e\u4e88\u5b9a\u306e\u8a71\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f<br>Have you gotten talks done for next month&#8217;s plans to Ito-san?<br><br>While perceived volition by the agent is an important factor in understanding most instances of \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b regardless of predicate type, contexts can be found in which it is used with non-volitional or volitional actions with both types.<br><br>5. \u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u3092\u898b\u305f\u3089\u3001\u8ca1\u5e03\u304c\u7f6e\u304d\u5fd8\u308c\u3066\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3088\u3002<br>When I looked at the table, there was a wallet left behind (by someone).<br><br>6a. \u304a\u3084\u3001\u30ac\u30b9\u304c\u3064\u3051\u3063\u3071\u306a\u3057\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3042\u308b\u3002<br>What&#8217;s this, (someone) left the gas on.<br><br>6b. \u304a\u3084\u3001\u30ac\u30b9\u3092\u3064\u3051\u3063\u3071\u306a\u3057\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3042\u308b\u3002\u3007\/\u25b3<br>What&#8217;s this, (someone) left the gas on.<br><br>Ex. 5 is a clear example of Type I being used with non-volitional actions, but there is a considerable decline in acceptance for 6b. in which Type II is used accordingly.

While with \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30fb\u3066\u3042\u308b, the predicate has already &#8220;realized&#8221; and the choice between the two illustrates how said realization persists (and possibly why), \uff5e\u3066\u304a\u304f only sets the context for &#8220;why&#8221; and its time frame must be set up externally. This can be attributed to how \u3042\u308b\u30fb\u3044\u308b are existential verbs with a firm footing in realities which are &#8216;in being,&#8217; while \u7f6e\u304f holds onto its literal sense of directionality, which is entirely dictated by the agent in both the sense of when and where. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though these three patterns are clearly distinct in their implications, studying sentences in which they are more or less interchangeable may also give us insight to how they are both similar and dissimilar.
