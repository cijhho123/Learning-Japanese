This word can appear numerous times in a single discourse, to the point you might get tired of looking at it. Surprisingly, this prolifically used word is hardly used in Modern Japanese, although the word may ring a bill from the word&nbsp;<ruby>\u8cdc\u7269<rt>\u305f\u307e\u3082\u306e<\/rt><\/ruby>&nbsp;(present), which is a combination of \u7d66\u3075 and \u7269.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively spelled as \u8cdc\u3075, this word literally refers to someone of&nbsp;<strong>high status<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>bestowing<\/strong>&nbsp;a benefit of some sort to someone of&nbsp;<strong>lower status<\/strong>. This resulted into it becoming an honorific verb and supplementary verb for&nbsp;<strong>showing respect to the agent of an action<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Japanese is notorious for its complex honorific language, but this system constantly undergoes restructuring. As centuries have gone by, Japanese speakers created newer ways to show respect. Consequently, \u7d66\u3075 has largely faded out of use. When it is seen nowadays, it\u2019s more common for it to not show respect at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because \u7d66\u3075 does not contribute much to Modern Japanese, our primary focus in this lesson will be to learn the diverse ways it was used in the past. If a usage happens to still be used, though, this will be mentioned accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pronunciation Note<\/strong>: Both the Modern and Classical Japanese pronunciation of \u7d66\u3075 is \u305f\u3082\u3046.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conjugating \u7d66\u3075<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Usages of \u7d66\u3075 can be conjugated as a \u56db\u6bb5 verb or as a \u4e8c\u6bb5 verb depending on the meaning. First, we need to know how its conjugations differ across these verb classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;\u6d3b\u7528\u5f62\u2193 \u52d5\u8a5e\u306e\u5f62\u614b \u2192<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u56db\u6bb5\u52d5\u8a5e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u4e8c\u6bb5\u52d5\u8a5e<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u672a\u7136\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;<strong>\u305f\u307e\u306f<\/strong><strong>\u207b\u30fb\u305f\u307e\u304a\u207b<\/strong><\/td><td>&nbsp;<strong>\u305f\u307e\u3078<\/strong><strong>\u207b<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u9023\u7528\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;<strong>\u305f\u307e\u3072<\/strong><strong>\u207b<\/strong><\/td><td>&nbsp;<strong>\u305f\u307e\u3078<\/strong><strong>\u207b<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u7d42\u6b62\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305f\u307e\u3075<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305f\u307e\u3075<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u9023\u4f53\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;<strong>\u305f\u307e\u3075<\/strong><\/td><td>&nbsp;<strong>\u305f\u307e\u3075\u308b<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u5df2\u7136\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;<strong>\u305f\u307e\u3078<\/strong><\/td><td>&nbsp;<strong>\u305f\u307e\u3075\u308c<\/strong><strong>\u207b<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u547d\u4ee4\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;<strong>\u305f\u307e\u3078<\/strong><\/td><td>&nbsp;<strong>X<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As evident in the chart, only the \u7d42\u6b62\u5f62 is shared between the two classifications, which means you will need to take especial notice at how endings attach to it (and to what base) to understand \u7d66\u3075 correctly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving forward, all conjugations of \u7d66\u3075 would be in bold so that you can focus on deconstructing them.

In Classical Japanese, there was no rule that said honorific and humble endings couldn\u2019t mix. Each element in a phrase like this indicated the hierarchy of respect with precision. She is still a court lady, an object of respect, which warrants \u805e\u3053\u3048\u308b. However, he is the Emperor, which is why the phrase ends with \u3055\u305b\u305f\u307e\u3075, showing utmost respect to him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>History Note<\/strong>: By the 15<sup>th<\/sup>&nbsp;century, \u305b\u7d66\u3046\u30fb\u3055\u305b\u7d66\u3046\u30fb\u3057\u3081\u7d66\u3046 had fallen out of use in the spoken language, but they did give rise to dialectal colloquial forms such as \u3055\u3057\u307e\u3046, \u3057\u3082, \u3055\u3057\u3080, \u3057\u307e\u3046, etc. Sadly, none of these forms contributed to Modern Japanese.

However, in this expression \uff5e\u3059 is being used to indicate respect rather than causation. This means that it is synonymous with \uff5e\u305b\u305f\u307e\u3075, with the parts being reversed so that it may stand as an independent verb. This verb, thus, means &#8220;to bestow&#8221; with the utmost respective given toward the bestower.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;\u672a\u7136\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9023\u7528\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7d42\u6b62\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9023\u4f53\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5df2\u7136\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u547d\u4ee4\u5f62<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u305f\u307e\u306f\u305b\u207b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305f\u307e\u306f\u305b\u207b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305f\u307e\u306f\u3059<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305f\u307e\u306f\u3059\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305f\u307e\u306f\u3059\u308c\u207b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305f\u307e\u306f\u305b\u3088<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>37.&nbsp;<ruby>\u5f8c\u6dbc\u6bbf<rt>\u3053\u3046\u3089\u3046\u3067\u3093<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306b\u3082\u3068\u3088\u308a\u3055\u3076\u3089\u3072<strong>\u305f\u307e\u3075<\/strong><ruby>\u66f4\u8863<rt>\u304b\u3046\u3044<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e<ruby>\u66f9\u53f8<rt>\u3056\u3046\u3057<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3092\u4ed6\u306b\u79fb<strong>\u3055\u305b\u305f\u307e\u3072\u3066<\/strong><ruby>\u4e0a\u5c40<rt>\u3046\u3078\u3064\u307c\u306d<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306b<strong>\u8cdc\u306f\u3059<\/strong>\u3002<br>(The emperor) moved the room of an attendant who had served him in the K\u014dr\u014d Pavilion for some time elsewhere, bestowing the (vacant) room close to Him to the attendant Kiritsubo.<br>From \u6e90\u6c0f\u7269\u8a9e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>38. \u304b\u306e\u5949\u308b<ruby>\u4e0d\u6b7b<rt>\u3075\u3057<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e\u85ac<ruby>\u58fa<rt>\u3064\u307c<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306b<ruby>\u6587<rt>\u3075\u307f<\/rt><\/ruby><ruby>\u5177<rt>\u3050<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3057\u3066<ruby>\u5fa1\u4f7f<rt>\u304a\u307b\u3093\u3064\u304b\u3072<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306b<strong>\u8cdc\u306f\u3059<\/strong>\u3002<br>Attaching the letter on the immortality medicine jar that she had presented, he passes it onto the messenger.&nbsp;<br>From \u7af9\u53d6\u7269\u8a9e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Transitive \u4e8c\u6bb5\u300c\u7d66\u3075\u30fb\u8cdc\u3075\u300d<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u7d66\u3075 was also used for the opposite meaning of \u201cto receive.\u201d It is not clear when this first began as examples can be found in Old Japanese.

Though \u305f\u3076 wasn\u2019t all that polite overall, it was nonetheless frequently paired with the supplementary honorific usage of \u7d66\u3075, producing \u305f\u3073\u305f\u307e\u3075. There was also \u305f\u3070\u305b\u7d66\u3075, which includes the auxiliary \u3059 to show even more respect.
