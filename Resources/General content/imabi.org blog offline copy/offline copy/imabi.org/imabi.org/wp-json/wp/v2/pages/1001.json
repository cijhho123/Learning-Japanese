Both nuances rely on Situation A being presumed established, but the exact nature of the contradiction set by Situation B differs &#8211; whether Situation B is a one-off, unexpected consequence or always so conversely consequential.

Whether Situation A is presumed to be the case or just a happenstance contrastive hypothetical condition (\u9006\u63a5\u4eee\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6) is not disambiguated via \uff5e\u3066\u3082.<br><br>8. \u3044\u304f\u3089\u6691\u3055\u306b\u5f37\u3044\u3068\u306f\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3082\u3001\u3053\u306e\u590f\u306e\u6691\u3055\u306b\u306f\u53c2\u3063\u3066\u308b\u3060\u308d\u3046\u3002<br>No matter how heat-resistant you say you are, you&#8217;d be overwhelmed by the heat this summer. <br><br>From \uff5e\u3066\u3082 alone, we do not know the exact nature of Situation A as it pertains to it being established fact or a hypothetical (and a hyperbolized one at that).
