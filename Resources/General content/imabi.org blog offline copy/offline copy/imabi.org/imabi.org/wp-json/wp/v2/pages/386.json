What dictates the usage of \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u304f and \uff5e\u3066\u304f\u308b is highly context driven. It&#8217;s rather impossible for even the best linguists to properly define all of the possible situations these phrases can be used in. &#8220;Highly context driven&#8221; refers to the fact that how you interpret them is not just determined by the transitivity of the verb phrase but by what exactly it is &#8220;semantically&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Categorical properties of what exactly the verb means is very important to keep in mind, and this also means that you can&#8217;t just assume that English and Japanese match perfectly on a word-by-word basis. Usually, even this is never the case. After all, the two languages are NOT related to each other.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>When&nbsp;<em><u>physical action<\/u><\/em>&nbsp;is involved, \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u304f and \uff5e\u3066\u304f\u308b show action away and action towards the speaker\u2019s current location respectively. In this case, the verbs are typically written in \u6f22\u5b57, but this is not always the case. At times, these phrases result in sentences that do not sound quite like anything one would say in English. In such cases, think really hard about the real world context in which they are used to better understand the semantic properties at work.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068<ruby>\u51fa<\/ruby>\u304b\u3051\u3066<ruby>\u6765<\/ruby>\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#8217;m going out for a bit (and will come back).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u516c\u5712\u306b\u6b69\u3044\u3066\u884c\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I went to the park by foot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: Remember that some \u3066 phrases act like adverbs in Japanese, which then can then like in this sentence equate to a prepositional phrase, in this case \u6b69\u3044\u3066 = by foot. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u671d\u3054\u98ef\u3092\u98df\u3079\u3066\u884c\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I went having eaten breakfast. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><ruby>4. \u884c<\/ruby>\u3063\u3066<ruby>\u6765<\/ruby>\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#8217;m going and coming back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Usage Note<\/strong>: The above phrase is used when leaving your residence, knowing that you will be coming back.

The semantic differences between the verbs of these phrases and differences in the main verbs used are important.

The status of the fire gets changed, and the process is &#8220;going out&#8221;. With \uff5e\u305f, you indicate that the process has just started. A strong wind, cutting off of fuel source, or lots of water put on it would determine how quickly it goes out. Nevertheless, the English can be used in the same situations. The second option indicates a process of disappearance. The flame will shortly start to fade and then go out. In a real world situation, it would be very hard to tell all these details, especially because these judgments are all subjective to what the speaker feels. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When considering the English equivalent, you should be able to see how it could be used for both.

It&#8217;s more vivid and doesn&#8217;t feel that it&#8217;s going to take long for this change to occur. Once it has become quite hotter, it could just reach a point and stay that way. The latter option doesn&#8217;t imply this. Rather, the latter shows a slower, gradual change that will occur and continue on that way. So, even if both sentences were used in the context of the temperature reaching 100F, with the latter, it could just continue to steadily get higher. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>More&nbsp;Examples<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Variant Note<\/strong>: It is also important to realize that \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u304f is often contracted to \uff5e\u3066\u304f in casual speech in the same way \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u308b is contracted to \uff5e\u3066\u308b.
