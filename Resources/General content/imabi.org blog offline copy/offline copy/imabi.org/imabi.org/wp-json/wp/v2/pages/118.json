What this means is that Japanese speakers are not as likely to directly say &#8220;no.&#8221; This sensitivity affects how the phrases in this lesson are used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u30fb\u3044\u3044\u3048<br>\u30fb\u3044\u3048<br>\u30fb\u3044\u3084<br>\u30fb\u5426<br>\u30fb\u3046\u3046\u3093<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u3044\u3044\u3048<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The antonym of \u306f\u3044 is \u3044\u3044\u3048. By default, it is the direct translation of &#8220;no.&#8221; It is the correct word for any non-verbal &#8220;no&#8221; you may encounter. For example, a &#8220;yes&#8221; and &#8220;no&#8221; window will display \u306f\u3044 (Y) and \u3044\u3044\u3048 (N). \u3044\u3044\u3048 is also the most formal and polite of all the variants of it. Although this point will be important to remember as we learn more about these phrases, understand that this is not an absolute and that there will be times when using \u3044\u3044\u3048 may cause an unwanted reaction. Next, we will look at its individual nuances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Usage 1<\/strong>:<strong> To express negation when presented a question that seeks affirmative or negative response (yes-no question).<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u300c\u96ea\u306f\u307e\u3060\u964d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f\u300d\u300c\u3044\u3044\u3048\u3001\uff12\u6642\u9593\u524d\u306b\u3084\u307f\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u300d<br>&#8220;Is it still snowing?&#8221; &#8220;No, it stopped snowing two hours ago.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.<br>\u4e0a\u53f8\uff1a\u4ffa\u3001\u3053\u3046\u3084\u308c\u3063\u3066\u8a00\u3063\u305f\uff1f<br>\u90e8\u4e0b\uff1a\u3044\u3044\u3048\u3001\uff08\u305d\u3046\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u305b\u3093\uff09\u3002<br>Boss: &#8220;Did I say for you to do it this way?&#8221;<br>Subordinate: &#8220;No(, you did not).&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Usage Note<\/strong>: At face value, it seems that the responder is replying politely. However, such a response, especially to a confrontational yes-no question would stir animosity. This is because a direct denial, even if the response is the truth, is not demonstrating the responsibility of fixing the perceived problem that the questioner is seeking. To stop confrontation, a response such as Ex. 3 would be appropriate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u3044\u3044\u3048\u3001\u8ab2\u9577\u306f\u305d\u3093\u306a\u98a8\u306b\u306f\u4ef0\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\u79c1\u304c\u9593\u9055\u3048\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3002\u5927\u5909\u7533\u3057\u8a33\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002<br>No, that is not how you said (to do it), Chief.

In formal, business situations, \u3044\u3044\u3048\u3001\u7d50\u69cb\u3067\u3059 is still preferred as a certain degree of directness is expected.
