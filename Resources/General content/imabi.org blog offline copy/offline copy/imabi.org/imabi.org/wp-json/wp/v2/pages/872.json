The overall tone of the statement is highly negative, but the overall sentence is not limited to be using with the negative. It is just that the extreme being mentioned is not a positive one.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u307e\u3057\u3066\u3084 is compromised of the verb \u5897\u3059 meaning &#8220;to increase&#8221; and the bound particle&nbsp;\u3084, which is used to add more of an emotional flare to the statements. Its use is optional, however, which allows the speaker to make the point that something is so blatantly obvious in a somewhat lighter fashion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although \u307e\u3057\u3066\u3084 is often followed by a comma, it is in fact an adverb and should not be viewed as a conjunction. It is also worth noting that this phrase is not used so often in the spoken language despite the emotional punch it can pack. One reason for why it is not used so much is the risk of using it towards a superior, which would be potentially very condescending at best depending on what you&#8217;re vexed about.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Orthography Note<\/strong>: \u307e\u3057\u3066\uff08\u3084\uff09 is only seldom written in kanji as \u6cc1\u3057\u3066\uff08\u3084\uff09.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u3042\u3044\u3064\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3092\u8aad\u3080\u3053\u3068\u3059\u3089\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3002\u307e\u3057\u3066\u3084\u66f8\u3044\u305f\u308a\u8a71\u3057\u305f\u308a\u3067\u304d\u308b\u308f\u3051\u304c\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>He can&#8217;t even read Japanese, much less write it or speak it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u5f7c\u5973\u306f\u5c0f\u8d70\u308a\u3082\u308d\u304f\u306b\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3002\u307e\u3057\u3066\u8d70\u308c\u308b\u308f\u3051\u304c\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>She can hardly jog, much less being able to run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u5148\u751f\u300c\u4eca\u56de\u306e\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u5e73\u5747\u70b9\u306f60\u70b9\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\u300d<br>A\u541b\u300c\u304a\u524d70\u70b9\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3044\u3063\u305f\uff1f\u300d<br>B\u541b\u300c\u307e\u3055\u304b\u3002\u5e73\u5747\u70b9\u3059\u3089\u5c4a\u304b\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3088\u3002\u307e\u3057\u3066\u308470\u70b9\u306a\u3093\u3066\u5922\u306e\u307e\u305f\u5922\u3060\u3088\u300d<br>Sensei: &#8220;The average for this test was 60&#8221;<br>A-kun: &#8220;Did you get over a 70?&#8221;<br>B-kun: &#8220;No way, I couldn&#8217;t even make the average, much less get a 70 which is like a hopeless dream&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u5148\u751f\u304c\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3093\u3060\u304b\u3089\u3001\u307e\u3057\u3066\u3084\u3042\u305f\u3057\u304c\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u308b\u306f\u305a\u304c\u306a\u3044\u308f\u3002<br>Since Sensei doesn&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s no way I, much less, would know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. \u79c1\u306f\u722c\u866b\u985e\u304c\u82e6\u624b\u3060\u3002\u307e\u3057\u3066\u3084\u86c7\u3068\u304b\u3092\u80a9\u306b\u4e57\u305b\u308b\u306a\u3093\u3066\u3068\u3093\u3067\u3082\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>I&#8217;m not good with reptiles, not to mention putting snakes or anything on my shoulders; that&#8217;d just wouldn&#8217;t fly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. \u8eca\u3092\u8cb7\u3046\u4f59\u88d5\u306a\u3093\u3066\u306a\u3044\u3002\u307e\u3057\u3066\u3084\u65b0\u8eca\u306a\u3093\u304b\u306f\u7d76\u5bfe\u306b\u8cb7\u3048\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>I don&#8217;t even have the luxury to buy a car.
