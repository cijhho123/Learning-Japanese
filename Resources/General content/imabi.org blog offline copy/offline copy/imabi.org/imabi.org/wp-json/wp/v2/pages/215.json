This serves as a semantic restriction on tense\/aspect in respect to \uff5e\u3068\u304d constructions, or at least for certain intended interpretations. As we know, \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u308b has two distinct functions. If you were to see \u7acb\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u304d, you would know to interpret this as meaning &#8220;when standing&#8221; not in the sense of just now standing but &#8220;having been standing and still standing.&#8221; <br>\u2461Durational verbs (\u7d99\u7d9a\u52d5\u8a5e) such as \u5bdd\u308b (to sleep) may also be referred to as &#8220;condition verbs&#8221; (\u72b6\u614b\u52d5\u8a5e) because of how the state they describe requires more than just a single snapshot of time.
