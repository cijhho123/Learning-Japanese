The root is \u304a\u306e-, which can be seen doubled in the expression \u5404\u3005 (each and every). Although there are a lot of possible set and at times very archaic expressions that use these words, only truly relevant examples will be brought up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>26. \u5df1\u3092\u77e5\u308c\u3002<br>Know thyself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>27. \u5df1\u306e\u8aac\u304f\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3092\u52b1\u884c\u305b\u3088\u3002<br>Practice what you preach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>28. \u5df1\u304c\u8ab0\u306a\u306e\u304b\u77e5\u308c\u3002<br>Know who you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>29a. \u5df1\u3092\u3082\u3063\u3066\u4ed6\u4eba\u3092\u5f8b\u3059\u308b\u306a\u3002<br>29a. \u81ea\u5206\u306e\u57fa\u6e96\u3067\u4ed6\u4eba\u3092\u5f8b\u3059\u308b\u306a\u3002(\u3082\u3063\u3068\u81ea\u7136\uff09<br>Don&#8217;t just others by yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>30. \u5bb9\u7591\u8005\u304c\u304a\u306e\u304a\u306e\u9055\u3063\u305f\u8aac\u660e\u3092\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>The suspects each gave a different story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>31. \u3069\u3053\u306e\u5b66\u6821\u3067\u3082\u65b0\u5165\u751f\u304c\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3001\u79c1\u306f\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u9bae\u306a\u6c17\u6301\u3061\u3067\u901a\u3044\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3082\u3001\u3068\u308a\u3068\u3081\u306e\u306a\u3044\u601d\u3044\u304c\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002\u77e5\u308a\u4eba\u306f\u9db4\u5ddd\u3067\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002\u3069\u3046\u3057\u3066\u3082\u9db4\u5ddd\u3068\u3070\u304b\u308a\u8a71\u3059\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3002\u305d\u308c\u3067\u306f\u6298\u89d2\u65b0\u3089\u3057\u3044\u4e16\u754c\u3078\u51fa\u3066\u6765\u305f\u610f\u5473\u304c\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3092\u3001\u9db4\u5ddd\u306e\u307b\u3046\u3067\u3082\u611f\u3058\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3089\u3057\u304f\u3001\u6570\u65e5\u305f\u3064\u3046\u3061\u306b\u3001\u4f11\u307f\u6642\u9593\u306b\u306f\u308f\u3056\u3068\u4e8c\u4eba\u304c\u96e2\u308c\u3066\u3001<strong>\u304a \u306e\u304c\u3058\u3057<\/strong>\u65b0\u3089\u3057\u3044\u53cb\u3092\u958b\u62d3\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u5403\u308a\u306e\u79c1\u306b\u306f\u3001\u305d\u3046\u3044\u3046\u52c7\u6c17\u3082\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3001\u9db4\u5ddd\u306e\u53cb\u304c\u5897\u3048\u308b\u306b\u3064\u308c\u3001\u79c1\u306f\u307e\u3059\u307e\u3059\u5b64\u308a\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3002&nbsp;<br>Like a new student in any school, while I went with fresh feelings each day, there was something I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to.
