However, when we say &#8220;November 16th,&#8221; it is unclear without context when that is, as it is not contingent on when the speaker utters the word. It could be November 16th, 2023 or that same date from any other year past or future. <br><br>Phrases relative to time of utterance &#8211; measured in relation to when &#8220;now&#8221; is to the speaker\u2014such as &#8220;now,&#8221; &#8220;yesterday,&#8221; &#8220;tomorrow,&#8221; etc. are examples of what is known as &#8220;deictic time.&#8221; <br><br>Deictic expressions in Japanese are notorious for being adverbial nouns, which means their part of speech wavers between &#8220;noun&#8221; and &#8220;adverb&#8221; depending on the grammatical context. More often than not, the presence or lack thereof of the particle \u306b will make the distinction clear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, deictic expressions are not marked by \u306b to denote time when used adverbially:<br><br>1a. \u79c1\u306f\u4eca\u3001\u672c\u3092\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3007<br>1b. \u79c1\u306f\u4eca\u306b\u3001\u672c\u3092\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002X<br>I am reading a book now.<br><br>2a. \u660e\u65e5\u3001\u8a66\u9a13\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3007<br>2b. \u660e\u65e5\u306b\u8a66\u9a13\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002X<br>There is an exam tomorrow.<br><br>When the particle \u306b, or any other case particle for that matter, is used after a time phrase, this indicates that it is being used as a noun, in which case it may still be deictic so long as the phrase is relative to when the speaker is talking. In these cases, \u306b is never temporal in function. <br><br>3. \u660e\u65e5\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u8272\u3005\u3068\u6e96\u5099\u3092\u3057\u3066\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I&#8217;ve made all sorts of preparations for tomorrow.<br><br>4. \u6628\u65e5\u306b\u623b\u308a\u305f\u3044\u3002<br>I want to return to yesterday.<br> <br>When a deictic time phrase is still being used adverbially with \u306b, the presence of \u306b ironically causes the phrase to lose its place on the &#8220;now&#8221; timeline, instead being context-based for proper interpretation. <br><br>5. \u6226\u4e89\u306f\u660e\u65e5\u306b\u3082\u8d77\u3053\u308a\u5f97\u308b\u3002<br>War could occur even tomorrow.<br><br>Though \u660e\u65e5 does still mean &#8220;tomorrow,&#8221; with the addition of \u306b, as imminent as the situation may feel, ironically, the war in question might just erupt next week. A degree of uncertainty compounded by the seriousness of the situation is what makes \u660e\u65e5\u306b not fall on the &#8220;now&#8221; timeline, making it non-deictic. <br><br>Then, there is the pesky problem when even the word &#8220;now,&#8221; the most deictic of all time phrases, can be interpreted in a non-deictic fashion. Rather than no longer meaning &#8220;now\/present time,&#8221; \u4eca\u306b translates to &#8220;before long,&#8221; which can be further emphasized as \u4eca\u306b\u3082, which is closer to &#8220;at any moment now.&#8221; <br><br>6. \u6226\u4e89\u304c\u7d42\u308f\u3089\u306a\u3044\u4eca\u3060\u304b\u3089\u3053\u305d\u3001\u5e73\u548c\u306e\u6b4c\u8a5e\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u308b\u306e\u3060\u3002(Deictic)<br>It&#8217;s precisely because war just won&#8217;t end in the present that (we) seek lyrics of peace.<br><br>7. \u6628\u591c\u306f\u96e8\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3068\u4e0a\u304c\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u4eca\u306b\u964d\u308a\u305d\u3046\u306a\u96f2\u884c\u304d\u3060\u3002(Non-Deictic)<br>Last night, the rain had finally let up, but the clouds look like it might rain any time now.<br><br>8. \u4eca\u306b\u3082\u751f\u7406\u304d\u305d\u3046\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb(Non-Deictic)<br>I feel like my period will come at any moment now&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Basic Deictic Expressions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Deictic time expressions can be organized by their level of formality.

Ideally, from earliest in the &#8220;evening,&#8221; if &#8220;evening&#8221; were to be defined in English as 6:00 P.M. to a bedtime of 10:00 P.M., the Japanese equivalents would be ordered as: \u5915\uff08\u65b9\uff09\uff1e\u6669\uff1e\u5bb5\uff1e\u591c.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u5915 marks the start of dusk, whereas \u6669 marks the end of dusk. \u5bb5 marks the start of night, but \u591c can still refer to any part of the night and even the evening in everyday conversation. <br><br>\u30fb\u4eca\u591c\uff08\u3053\u3093\u3084\uff09: This word is preferred over all other options listed below. <br>\u30fb\u4eca\u6669\uff08\u3053\u3093\u3070\u3093\uff09: Analyzing \u4eca\u6669 as being more formal than \u4eca\u591c is misleading. Though it is true that it is heavily used in the phrase \u4eca\u6669\u306f and that it may be used in \u6328\u62f6 exchanges in general, it is used in this way because of its traditionally allotted time. Nightlives simply were not a thing before the modern era. The favoring of \u4eca\u591c over \u4eca\u6669 is a reflection of the change of times. <br>\u30fb\u4eca\u5915\uff08\u3053\u3093\u305b\u304d\uff09: If \u4eca\u6669 and \u4eca\u591c exist, then so must \u4eca\u5915. Unfortunately, it is rarely used, being largely restricted to literature. To make matters more confusing, it may even be read as \u3053\u3093\u3086\u3046, which is itself a contraction of \u3053\u306e\u5915.<br>\u30fb\u4eca\u5bb5\uff08\u3053\u3088\u3044\uff09: \u5bb5 specifically means &#8220;early night hours.&#8221; \u4eca\u5bb5 is very poetic and frequently seen in literature and music. <br>\u30fb\u304d\u3087\u3046\u306e\uff5b\u5915\u65b9\u30fb\u6669\u30fb\u591c\uff5d: Technically, \u304d\u3087\u3046\u306e\uff5b\u5915\u65b9\u30fb\u6669\u30fb\u591c\uff5d may either function as deictic or non-deictic expressions, the difference coming down to whether the particle \u306b is used. By using \u304d\u3087\u3046\u306e as the modifier, focus is no longer on the time period being &#8220;today&#8221; in the present but the time of day, which is something that repeats regardless of when &#8220;now&#8221; is felt by you. Nonetheless, the deictic \u4eca\u591c\u30fb\u4eca\u6669 are still far more prevalent than their non-deictic counterparts, with \u304d\u3087\u3046\u306e\u5915\u65b9 standing out as being unambiguously before it is actually dark. <br><br>28. \u4eca\u591c\u4f55\u3057\u3088\u3046\u304b\u306a\uff1f\u6620\u753b\u3067\u3082\u898b\u308b\uff1f<br>What&#8217;re we gonna do tonight?

It must be noted, however, that in formal language, its use is drastically lower compared to \u3042\u3059 and \u307f\u3087\u3046\u306b\u3061. <br>\u30fb\u660e\u65e5\uff08\u3042\u3059\uff09: \u3042\u3059 is also believed to ultimately share etymology with \u671d and \u3042\u3057\u305f. In Modern Japanese, it has a less colloquial tone than \u3042\u3057\u305f, but it is still heavily used nonetheless in both speech and writing. It may even mean &#8220;the near future.\u201d<br>\u30fb\u660e\u65e5\uff08\u307f\u3087\u3046\u306b\u3061\uff09: \u660e\uff08\u307f\u3087\u3046\uff09is indicative of formal, written language for all the words it creates. With &#8220;tomorrow&#8221; being no different, to switch back to being informal, use \u3042\u3057\u305f. It must be noted, though, that \u307f\u3087\u3046\u306b\u3061 is used heavily in business in both the spoken and written language. A reason for this may be because it is pronounced without devoicing any vowels thus, completely unambiguous. <br><br>38. \u3042\u3059\u306f\u5404\u5730\u3067\u9752\u7a7a\u304c\u5e83\u304c\u308b\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002<br>Tomorrow, blue skies will spread out all over.<br><br>39. \u660e\u65e5\u307e\u3067\u5fd9\u3057\u3044\u3002\uff08\u3042\u3057\u305f\u30fb\u3042\u3059 \uff2f\uff2b\uff09<br>I will be busy until tomorrow.<br><br>40. \u660e\u65e5\u307e\u3067\u306b\u7d42\u308f\u3089\u305b\u3066\u307b\u3057\u3044\u3002\uff08\u3042\u3057\u305f\u30fb\u3042\u3059\uff2f\uff2b\uff09<br>I want you to finish this by tomorrow.<br><br>41. \u304d\u3087\u3046\u306f\u4eba\u306e\u8eab\u3001\u3042\u3059\u306f\u6211\u304c\u8eab\u3002(NOT literally &#8220;tomorrow&#8221; per se)<br>What happens to one today may happen to another tomorrow.<br><br>42. \u3067\u306f\u3001\u660e\u65e5\uff08\u307f\u3087\u3046\u306b\u3061\uff09\u307e\u305f\u304a\u96fb\u8a71\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>Alright then, I will call again tomorrow.<br><br>\u25a0Tomorrow {Morning\/Evening\/Night}<br><br>\u30fb\u660e\u65e5\u306e\u3010\u671d\u30fb\u5915\u65b9\u30fb\u6669\u30fb\u591c\u3011: These phrases may function deictically (indicated by the dropping of \u306b combined with a sentence-initial placement) or non-deictically (indicated by the presence of \u306b). These dual-purposed phrases are more prevalent in both speaking and writing than their solely deictic counterparts which utilize \u660e\uff5e. <br>\u30fb\u660e\u65e5\u306e\u6669: This combination is notably far less common due to speakers favoring \u5915\u65b9 and \u591c. Some feel that \u6669 is more formal in isolated contexts such as this, but strictly speaking, it is not entirely synonymous with either. <br>\u30fb\u660e\u671d: This word has two possible readings: \u307f\u3087\u3046\u3061\u3087\u3046 and \u307f\u3087\u3046\u3042\u3055. The latter reading is more likely to be encountered in formal-sounding speech.
