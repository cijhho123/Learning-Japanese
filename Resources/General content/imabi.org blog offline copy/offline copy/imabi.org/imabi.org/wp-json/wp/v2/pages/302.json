In his analysis, there are two factors that govern the grammaticality of \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044: a syntactic component and a semantic component. <br><br>The syntactic component is that when \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044 is juxtaposed with \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b, or said juxtaposition is inferred, \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044 may be used, and this likelihood increases with derivatives.

The core meaning of \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u308b is the progressive aspect and\/or the aspect of an effect being maintained. In addition to this, it also has a perfect tense aspect to it: the situation has been a thing since before a set time and maintains its effect beyond that set time. For instance, in &#8220;I have eaten it,&#8221; the act of eating happened before the present, the time of eating was before the present, but the act of the object being eaten remains true into the present and will continue to be true in the future. This subtle difference between something like &#8220;I have eaten it&#8221; and &#8220;I was eating&#8221; is, albeit meticulously, still distinguishable in context with \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u308b, so the big question is how do these two interrelated aspects affect the grammaticality of \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044. <br><br>\u4e45\u91ce (1983) posits that when the perfect aspect is at work, \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044 ought to be the only form possible, but for the perfect aspect to only work, other factors are at play. <br><br>69. \u65b0\u805e\u3092\u8aad\u3080\u307e\u3067\u306b\u592a\u90ce\u306f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u306e\u771f\u76f8\u3092\uff5b\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044 \u3007\u30fb\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044 X\uff5d\u3002(+Perfect)<br>Until Taro reads the newspaper, he will not have known the truth of the case.<br><br>70. \u592a\u90ce\u306f\u4eca\u307e\u3067\u4e00\u5ea6\u3082\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u9650\u754c\u3092\uff5b\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044 \u3007\u30fb\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044 X\uff5d\u3002(+Perfect)<br>Taro has as of yet never once known his limit. <br><br>The main factor that prevents this ideal condition is the situation aspect (\u72b6\u614b\u6027) that usually defines \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b in the negative. What&#8217;s more, many instances of \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044 that follow the syntactic factor that rely on parallelism are not in the perfect aspect (Exs. 66~68). To combat this, \u4e45\u91ce (1983) states that \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044 can only be used in abnormal scenarios, but that since they are &#8216;scenarios,&#8217; it can incidentally show up when the perfect aspect is not present. <br><br>Expanding on this notion, \u524d\u7530 (2010) posits that the difference between individual-level and stage-level predicates is at play. Individual-level predicates are statements that are true of individuals as a whole. For instance, in &#8220;Taro is Japanese,&#8221; the predicate is always true unless an outstanding circumstance is at play. A stage-level predicate is only true of an individual for a certain duration. For instance, &#8220;Taro is sick&#8221; does not inherently imply how long he has been sick or will be sick, but it is assumed that that state has not been so forever and that it won&#8217;t last forever. <br><br>When \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u308b is used with instantaneous verbs to represent continued effect, the resultant predicate is a stage-level predicate because it may be ongoing but it may not be forever. In the negative, if the speaker focuses on how the event still has not happened, it still functions as a stage-level predicate, but if the speaker does not focus on the existence of the event and only mentions how it is not so, then it is an individual-level predicate. <br><br>71a. \u592a\u90ce\u304c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u306e\u771f\u76f8\u3092\u4f55\u3082\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3002(Individual-Level Predicate)<br>71b. \u592a\u90ce\u304c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u306e\u771f\u76f8\u3092\u4f55\u3082\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3002(Stage-Level Predicate)<br>71a. Taro knows nothing about the truth of the case. <br>71b. Taro has yet to know anything about the truth of the case.<br><br>Thus, when the perfect aspect is not in play, the difference in predicate type will exemplify how \u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044 and \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044 are interpreted &#8211; (reflect on Ex. 68). What Ex. 71 shows us, also, is that if &#8220;has yet to know&#8221; sounds unnecessarily wordy to get the point across, the same holds true in Japanese, which is why 71b is normally not heard. As for Exs. 69-70, although \u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044 is most certainly ungrammatical, \u7406\u89e3\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044 would be the most natural word choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another factor \u4e45\u91ce(1983) posits is how subjectivity comes into play. He points out that \u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044 is from the perspective of the subject about the lack of knowledge being discussed, whereas \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044 is an objective outward perspective regarding the lack of knowledge. Because of this, \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044 is never used in first-person because everyone will always be biased towards themselves.<br><br>Although Japanese does carve out stage-level predicates combined with the perfect aspect as the best scenario to use \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044, it provides so many more efficient means of avoiding that scenario. Aside from the examples shown here which are continuously recycled when discussing its grammaticality, \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044 remains quite elusive, with examples not exceeding its confines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other Dialects &amp; Real Examples<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When stepping outside the confines of Standard Japanese, we actually find that everything regarding \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044 being valid is thrown out the window.
