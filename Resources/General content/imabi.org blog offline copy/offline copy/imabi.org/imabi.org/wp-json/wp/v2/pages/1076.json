First, let&#8217;s understand what these three terms mean.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Unergative Verb (= \u975e\u80fd\u683c\u52d5\u8a5e): An intransitive verb that only has a semantic agent.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Unaccusative Verb&nbsp;(= \u975e\u5bfe\u683c\u52d5\u8a5e): An intransitive verb whose grammatical subject is not a semantic agent. Meaning, the subject neither &#8216;actively initiates&#8217; nor is willfully responsible for the action of the verb.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Transitive Verb (= \u4ed6\u52d5\u8a5e): A verb with an active agent and an object which receives the action.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The majority of \u3064\u304f-onomatopoeic verbs are unaccusative verbs. Meaning, their grammatical subjects differ from verbs like &#8220;to run.&#8221; &#8220;To run&#8221; along with its Japanese equivalent \u8d70\u308b&nbsp;are examples of unergative verbs as their subjects are willful agents of the action they describe, but they don&#8217;t possess an object. On the other hand, unaccusative verbs are more similar to the objects of transitive sentences in the sense that they don&#8217;t act upon anything, but the action can be described as something happening to the subject.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for what \uff5e\u3064\u304f means in relation to onomatopoeia, it appears to have two separate meanings. The first meaning is to mark a &#8220;change described by the onomatopoeia&#8221; and the second meaning is to mark &#8220;the action described by the onomatopoeia.&#8221; The first meaning is fitting for the unaccusative examples whereas the second meaning is fitting for the transitive and unergative examples.

Although this is true in standard speech, there are parts of Japan where this word is still in common use. For instance, in Nagano it is still used with the meaning &#8220;to rage&#8221; and in Ehime it is&nbsp;especially used in the sense of &#8220;to rough-house.&#8221; Where this word is still commonly used, it demonstrates no restrictions to its conjugational capacity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2461\u9119 is an out-of-date noun meaning, &#8220;land far removed from the city.&#8221; As a standalone noun, it may still be found in the expression \u9119\u306b\u306f\u7a00\u306a meaning, &#8220;rare even in the middle of nowhere.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes it synonymous with \u7530\u820e. There is a decent percentage of people who misunderstand this word as meaning &#8220;to be sophisticated,&#8221; perhaps due to the nostalgic ring this word has as opposed to the synonymous \u7530\u820e\u3073\u308b. However, this is not a valid use of the word as it is used throughout Japan with its original meaning as can be gleamed from the dialectal sentence&nbsp;in Ex. 56.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2462\u96c5\u3073\u308b is the antonym of \u9119\u3073\u308b, which is ironic considering how the latter is misused with a similar meaning to that of \u96c5\u3073\u308b. The \u307f\u3084 in this word is likely the same \/miya\/ as in the words \u5bae (palace) and \u90fd\uff08\u307f\u3084\u3053\uff09 (capital). In this word, it would seem \/miya\/ has the literal meaning of &#8220;city.&#8221; Thus, \u96c5\u3073\u308b more literally means &#8220;behaving city-like.&#8221; In Modern Japanese, although \u96c5\u3073\u308b is defunct and limited to literature, the noun \u96c5\uff08\u307f\u3084\uff09\u3073&nbsp;is still widely known in the sense of &#8220;elegance&#8221; as well as a personal name. \u96c5\u3073&nbsp;can also be used as an adjectival noun with the meaning of &#8220;elegant.&#8221;&nbsp;<br>\u2463Though common in Classical Japanese as \u5e7c\uff08\u3092\u3055\u306a\uff09\u3076, the modern form \u5e7c\u3073\u308b has mostly been replaced by the paraphrased equivalent \u5e7c\u304f\u898b\u3048\u308b.&nbsp;<br>\u2464The \/horo\/ in \u6ec5\u3073\u308b is thought to be onomatopoeic in nature. Although \u307b\u308d\u307b\u308d has several nonrelated meanings in Modern Japanese, it does have the meaning of &#8220;breaking into pieces (with little effort).&#8221; Although \u6ec5\u3073\u308b is the proper form, the five-grade form \u6ec5\u3076 has existed for centuries.

Although dictionaries do not state any grammatical constraints on the practical use of words made with \uff5e\u3081\u304b\u3059, aside from \u4ec4\u3081\u304b\u3059 (which happens to be a commonly used word), the rest are restricted to being used in adverbial gerunds with the particle \u3066 or as attributes with the auxiliary \uff5e\u305f.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would also appear to be the case that aside from \u4ec4\u3081\u304b\u3059 and \u5197\u8ac7\u3081\u304b\u3059, most examples can be viewed as conceptions on the part of the speaker to create a unique remark. There is a heightened literary sense made when employing this ending which would otherwise not be had if a more standard phrasing were used.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>76. \u300c\u3044\u3084\u3001\u6bce\u65e5\u3001\u304a\u524d\u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u3044\u305f\u3044\u306e\u3060\u3001\u300d\u3068\u592b\u306f<strong>\u5197\u8ac7\u3081\u304b\u3057\u3066<\/strong>\u8a00\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>&#8220;No, I want to be with you every day,&#8221; my husband said (half-)jokingly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>77.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>\u4ec4\u3081\u304b\u3057\u305f<\/strong>\u3060\u3051\u3060\u3002<br>I only suggested.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\uff5e\u3084\u304f<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\uff5e\u3084\u304f is yet another affix which indicates behavior, but it is limited to a very small number of onomatopoeic roots.
