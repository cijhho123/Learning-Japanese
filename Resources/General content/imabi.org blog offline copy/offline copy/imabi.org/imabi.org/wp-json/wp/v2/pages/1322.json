The auxiliary verbs \uff5e\u305f\u308a and \uff5e\u308a are about results, continuation, and the past tense. \uff5e\u305f\u308a is the ancestor of \uff5e\u305f, the all for one ending that replaced all of these endings. Although \uff5e\u308a came first, we will start this discussion by talking about the most important of two endings, \uff5e\u305f\u308a.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Auxiliary Verb \uff5e\u305f\u308a<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\uff5e\u305f\u308a comes from \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308a. In Modern Japanese, there is a difference between \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b, \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u308b, and \uff5e\u305f. However, in Classical Japanese, \uff5e\u305f\u308a served all three of these purposes. \uff5e\u305f\u308a first appeared way back in the \u5948\u826f\u6642\u4ee3, when the ending -\u308a was prevalent for the same functions \uff5e\u305f\u308a has. So, why did \uff5e\u305f\u308a come to be? It is because \uff5e\u308a could only follow \u56db\u6bb5 and&nbsp;\u30b5\u5909&nbsp;verbs. As no such restriction was placed on \uff5e\u305f\u308a, it led to its prevalence after the \u5948\u826f\u6642\u4ee3, resulting in \uff5e\u305f dominating over several other endings relating to the past.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\uff5e\u305f began being used as early as the \u938c\u5009\u6642\u4ee3. However, it took until the \u6c5f\u6238\u6642\u4ee3 for the continuative and resultative functions of \uff5e\u305f\u308a to be replaced by \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b and \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u308b. Now, let&#8217;s go into more detail about what these functions are.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; First and foremost, the bases of \uff5e\u305f\u308a, which follow a \u30e9\u5909 conjugation, are as follows.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;\u672a\u7136\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9023\u7528\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7d42\u6b62\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9023\u4f53\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5df2\u7136\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u547d\u4ee4\u5f62<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u305f\u3089<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305f\u308a<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305f\u308a<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305f\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305f\u308c<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305f\u308c<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>The Six Functions of \uff5e\u305f\u308a<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Continuative<\/strong>: This is &#8220;-ing&#8221; in English and \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u308b in Modern Japanese.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Resultative<\/strong>: This is &#8220;has been&#8221; in English and \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b in Modern Japanese.

This caused a merging of &#8220;-i+a&#8221; which lead to &#8220;e&#8221;. It was then treated as an auxiliary verb that followed the \u5df2\u7136\u5f62\u30fb\u547d\u4ee4\u5f62 of \u56db\u6bb5 verbs as well as the \u672a\u7136\u5f62 of \u30b5\u5909 verbs. It was very common in works from the \u5948\u826f\u6642\u4ee3 such as the \u4e07\u8449\u96c6.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\uff5e\u308a wasn&#8217;t completely abandoned however. It still survived in Japanese-Chinese style writing. \uff5e\u308a has the same resultative, continuative, and past tense functions as \uff5e\u305f\u308a. It&#8217;s just that its lack of versatility in the kind of verbs that could follow is what caused its demise overall.
