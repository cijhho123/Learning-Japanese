It has been the source of worship and reverence from cultures across the world due to both its nurturing and destructive powers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wherever you are in the world, the air contains some amount of water vapor. This water vapor may originate from evaporation (\u84b8\u767a) off the oceans (\u6d77\u6d0b), lakes (\u6e56), or the ground (\u5730\u9762) or it may be provided by transpiration (\u84b8\u6563) from plants (\u690d\u7269). Rain falls from the sky out of clouds (\u96f2), but rain is also not the only form of precipitation. Furthermore, the process of water going from liquid to gas to liquid\/solid and so on creates a cycle known as the &#8220;water cycle.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though words associated with rain such as \u96e8 (rain), \u96e8\u96f2 (raincloud), \u96f7\u96e8 (thunderstorm), etc. may seem simple, the Japanese language is rich with rain-related words. Just the words to describe the various of aspects of precipitation thus far requires an extensive knowledge of weather vocabulary, much of which you would naturally learn from watching weather reports (\u5929\u6c17\u4e88\u5831).&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On other planets, what falls as &#8220;rain&#8221; may not be made of water, but in this discussion, we&#8217;ll mostly be talking about the H2O that falls out of our sky.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Kanji for Rain \u300c\u96e8\u300d\u3068\u3044\u3046\u6f22\u5b57\u306e\u8d77\u6e90<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/mediaprocessor.websimages.com\/width\/279\/crop\/0%2C0%2C279x101\/www.imabi.net\/Origin%20of%20Rain%20Kanji.gif?w=900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kanji for &#8220;rain,&#8221; despite its gradual change in form over the millennia, is still recognizable as a pictograph (\u8c61\u5f62\u6587\u5b57) even in its printed style (\u6977\u66f8\u4f53) used today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In oracle bone text (\u7532\u9aa8\u6587) from ancient China, \u96e8 appeared like the far left with a line representing a cloud and the raindrops represented by multiple slashes beneath.

The rainy season in Japan is still known as \u6885\u96e8, although this word may also be read with its ON readings as \u30d0\u30a4\u30a6, especially in compounds such as&nbsp;\u6885\u96e8\u524d\u7dda (seasonal rain front).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u203b\u96e8\u9732 may be read as \u30a6\u30ed or \u3042\u3081\u3064\u3086.

It can either refer to the phenomenon of precipitation falling to the surface, or it can refer to precipitation that has fallen. In the latter case, it would be colloquially understood a &#8220;rainfall,&#8221; but the macro interpretation which encompasses any form of precipitation is what is used in any meteorological context. For instance,&nbsp;\u964d\u6c34\u78ba\u7387 (chance of precipitation) on your phone doesn&#8217;t just refer to rain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In more technical weather reports, the Kanji&nbsp;\u6c34 will be switched out for the Kanji of the precipitation being particularly referenced. Thus, &#8220;rainfall&#8221; is&nbsp;\u964d\u96e8\uff08\u3053\u3046\u3046\uff09, &#8220;snowfall&#8221; is \u964d\u96ea\uff08\u3053\u3046\u305b\u3064\uff09, and &#8220;hailfall&#8221; is either \u964d\u96f9\uff08\u3053\u3046\u3072\u3087\u3046\uff09&nbsp;or \u964d\u9730\uff08\u3053\u3046\u3055\u3093\uff09 depending on the size of the hail (see above for size differentiation).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the spoken language, \u964d\u6c34, \u964d\u96e8, and \u964d\u96ea are fairly common as they&#8217;re often used by weather reporters. However, \u964d\u96f9 is rarely heard and \u964d\u9730 would only be understood in the written language. To combat this, the native phrasings of these words are used in everyday conversation instead.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if one&#8217;s goal is to use &#8220;precipitation&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;amount of&#8230;that fell,&#8221; you&#8217;ll need to add \u91cf, whether you&#8217;re using formal Sino-Japanese vocabulary or colloquial native vocabulary. As for the Sino-Japanese vocabulary, those compounds can be understood in the same two ways as \u964d\u6c34.

Why is there an intrusive \/s\/ in words such as \u6625\u96e8? Also, where is there a number of onomatopoeia which share this \/s\/ sound? On top of this, although most native rain-related vocabulary utilizes some form of \/ame\/, the word \u6a0b\uff08\u3068\u3044\uff09 meaning &#8220;gutter&#8221; is a major exception to this norm.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These factors have driven some linguists to posture whether rain-related vocabulary from other language families might have contributed to the Japanese lexicon. Though such hypotheses require a major pinch of salt, let&#8217;s look at some potential ties that have been posited.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Old Japanese, there have been \/s\/ initial rain-related words such as \u305d\u307c\u964d\u308b (gentle rain falling), which would have been pronounced as \/<strong>sopo<\/strong>puru\/ at that time.&nbsp;Ignoring the actual quality of the o-vowels of the language at the time, derivative expressions such as&nbsp;\u3069\u307c\u3093 (onomatopoeia for to &#8220;plop&#8221;) ,&nbsp;\u307d\u3068\u307d\u3068 (onomatopoeia of large drops), \u307b\u3068\u3070\u3057\u308b (to gush out) and \u6f64\uff08\u307b\u3068\uff09\u3073\u308b (to swell from absorbed moisture) abound with \/s\/ being exchanged out for \/t\/ or \/h~p\/.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, onomatopoeia such as&nbsp;\u3056\u3076\u3056\u3076 (onomatopoeia for gushing), \u3055\u3070\u3055\u3070 (candid), \u3055\u3063\u3071\u308a (refreshing). \u3056\u3076\u3093 (splash\/plop), etc. exist which don&#8217;t deviate as much as the previous examples. What&#8217;s more, the onomatopoeia in&nbsp;\u3055\u3081\u3056\u3081 (crying sorrowfully) is also likely related.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drop the \/s\/ and have \/b~p\/ solidify to \/m\/ and then one gets \/ame\/. Thus, \/ame\/ can be viewed as just one of many derivatives&nbsp;of the initial onomatopoeic expressions. To some scholars, these word forms are thought to potentially have been borrowed from the Austronesian language family in which \/sebu\/ is a potential reconstruction of a rain-related word.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for potential Korean influence, we would need evidence of rain-related words that ultimately don&#8217;t relate to the \u305d\u307b morpheme found in Old Japanese, but considering how this morpheme would have already given rise to its derivatives including \u96e8 by that period, such influence would have to be far more ancient.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Modern Korean, the word for &#8220;rain&#8221; is \/pi\/. The only rain-related word with this sound in Japanese is \u6a0b. In Classical Japanese, it had the reading&nbsp;\u3068\u3072, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;\u3072 would have been pronounced as \/pi\/ in Old Japanese. Even if this were viewed as an embedded morpheme, the word itself would be an amalgamation&nbsp;of a random borrowing into the language and not indicative of rain terminology being shared with Korean.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In Conclusion\u2026\u3000\u6700\u5f8c\u306b\u2026<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this lesson, we have thoroughly gone over all sorts of rain-related terminology that exists in Japanese from various angles.
