The meaning behind \u5143\u6c17 is certainly one to capsulate in the name of a textbook series. Whether or not this textbook is the one chosen for instruction, within day one, a learner will likely leave&nbsp;the classroom having learned that&nbsp;\u304a\u5143\u6c17\u3067\u3059\u304b is the Japanese phrase&nbsp;\u201cHow are you?\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, we have already gone over the variety of ways to going about &#8220;how are you&#8221; in&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.imabi.net\/dailyexpressionsii.htm\">Lesson 105<\/a>.

This phrase is used to directly ask about someone&#8217;s well-being, so it is notably not the same as the general &#8220;how are you?&#8221; question that English speakers are so eager to use it as. Instead, phrases such as \u300c\u6700\u8fd1\u3001\u8abf\u5b50\u306f\u3069\u3046\u3067\u3059\u304b\u300dwould be far more natural, but why is that? First, it&#8217;s important to note that the phrase \u304a\u5143\u6c17\u3067\u3059\u304b isn&#8217;t wrong, but it serves a certain purpose.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10. \u3059\u3063\u304b\u308a\u3054\u7121\u6c99\u6c70\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001<strong>\u304a\u5143\u6c17\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b<\/strong>\u3002<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven&#8217;t seen you in such a long time.

However, if the phrase is to be used at all in polite speech in writing, the form \u304a\u5143\u6c17\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b&nbsp;is overwhelmingly preferred. The key point here is that we&#8217;re looking at the&nbsp;<strong>written language<\/strong>. Either way, you aren&#8217;t going to hear this spoken unless for some reason the speaker assumes that using \u304a\u5143\u6c17\u3067\u3059\u304b may facilitate better understanding with you being a second language speaker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are writing to a pen pal, using \u5143\u6c17\u3067\u3059\u304b&nbsp;would be&nbsp;appropriate, but if you&#8217;ve ever been in the position of reading actual letters between adults, whether they be acquaintances, coworkers, or boss-employee interactions, the exact phrasing \u304a\u5143\u6c17\u3067\u3059\u304b isn&#8217;t seen. This is because current \u656c\u8a9e norms have favored other phrases, or at least more honorific grammar on top of \u5143\u6c17 (Examples 31-36). We can surmise that the phrase has become a \u6b7b\u8a9e, a phrase that is still recognized by speakers but is no longer used in natural discourse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrastingly, \u5143\u6c17? by itself may be used in conversation, but there are many speakers that feel like when it is used, even in a casual situation, that the speaker is choosing to use it in a more Western way, therefore treating it no differently than its polite iteration. This is understandable because it is still not quite like &#8220;how are you?&#8221; in English, which is what the speaker would be trying to go for.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11. \u3088\u30fc\u3001\u5143\u6c17\u304b\uff1f (Masculine, casual, comedic)<br>What&#8217;s up, how are ya?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of the particle \u304b is grammatical here, but the circumstance in which someone would actually say \u5143\u6c17\u304b would be limited to male speakers in a casual setting for a particular effect on the mood to the interaction with the listener.

Although in the last two examples it was shown in postcard-worthy birthday messages, how would the phrase be interpreted if you were to use it to your partner or a friend?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it is perceivable that someone may use this phrase in its original connotation of wishing that the person be healthy and happy, if the tone is not sincere, not thinking much of it when you say it would certainly take away from its original message, or worse, you could be implying that you&#8217;re not going to see that person again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the situation,&nbsp;the person may respond to you with\u300c\u3042\u306a\u305f\u3082\u3001\u304a\u5143\u6c17\u3067\u300d&nbsp;, but their own emotional state could be just as complicated. They could be sad about the prospect of not seeing you again, or they could be fine if neither side really intended to put much thought behind the words.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, \u304a\u5143\u6c17\u3067 is thought of as a breakup line when said by a boyfriend\/girlfriend. Whether it&#8217;s because the person feels like they will no longer be able to see each other or because they really want to break up would have to be determined by the context, but the end result would be implied no differently.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These connotations likely go in line with how \u304a\u5143\u6c17\u3067 is overly used in formal writing. The presence of honorific speech does at a fundamental level indicate that the writer is likely not at familial terms with the other person. In fact, \u304a\u5143\u6c17\u3067 does also find itself used in addresses to acquaintances and people at the workplace who are moving away, so the word is often thought of as something you say to people who you won&#8217;t be seeing anymore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even as a farewell statement, pairing it with \u3055\u3088\u3046\u306a\u3089 is also a little complicated. If you were to write\u300c\u304a\u5143\u6c17\u3067\u3001\u3055\u3088\u3046\u306a\u3089\u300d, it would almost sound like, &#8220;Ok, stay safe, bye&#8230;&#8221; in English. Even though the wording is nice on the surface, it sounds like you&#8217;re angry, in a way, with the other person. On the other hand, if you were to write\u300c\u3055\u3088\u3046\u306a\u3089\u3001\u304a\u5143\u6c17\u3067\u300d, you are still no longer going to be able to see the other person, but you are at least giving your best wishes to them regarding their well-being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>37. \u5143\u6c17\u3067\u3010\u306d\u30fb\u306a\u3011<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>38. \u5143\u6c17\u3067\u3044\u3066\uff08\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\uff09\u306d\u3002<br>Please take care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>39. \u5143\u6c17\u3067\u3044\u3066\u304f\u308c\u3088\u3002\uff08\u30ab\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u3001\u7537\u6027\u5c02\u7528\uff09<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take care, man.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These phrases are all similar to \u304a\u5143\u6c17\u3067 in that you might not see the person again, but the usual sense is that it&#8217;ll likely just be a while till you see them again, so you want them to know that you&#8217;re caring about their well-being in the meantime.

The adverbial form of an adjectival phrase has to be paired with \u3059\u308b, so the only way to use \u3067 would be to simply not use this grammar pattern. In these examples, we still see a tendency to favor \u306b over \u3067.
