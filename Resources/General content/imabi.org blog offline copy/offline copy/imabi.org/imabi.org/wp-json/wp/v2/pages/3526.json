Truly, the reason for why \u306b may mark a result is because results are borne from its ability to mark destination and duration. <br><br>6. \u4e16\u754c\u306f\u5927\u6df7\u4e71\u306b\u9665\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>The world fell into a state of utter chaos.<br><br>Here, we see that [utter chaos] is both the result of said change indicated by \u9665\u308b as well as the location in which [the world] has fallen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas for the particle \u3068, the results feel instantaneous, spontaneous even.

In Ex. 53, Noun X is \u4ed5\u4e8b and Noun Y is [\u3084\u3081\u308b\u3053\u3068]. <br><br>53. \u4ed5\u4e8b\u3092\u3084\u3081\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u6c7a\u3081\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I [decided\/chose] to quit my job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Noun X \uff0b Noun X&#8217; \uff0b\u3068\u3059\u308b<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In light of what we have learned about the particle \u3068 and its relation to change, it would be a mistake to also blanketly label \uff5e\u3068\u3059\u308b as being a formal iteration of \uff5e\u306b\u3059\u308b. In fact, the two could not be more different. For the time being, however, \uff5e\u3068\u3059\u308b may be simply understand as (re)defining what Noun X is. As such, viewing it as &#8220;as&#8221; is the easiest way to understand its basic function here. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>54. 2\u5104\u5186\u3092\u8eab\u4ee3\u91d1<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u3068\u3059\u308b<\/span>\u3002<br>To <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">have<\/span> 200 million yen <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">as<\/span> ransom.<br><br>55. \uff12\u5104\u5186\u3092\u8eab\u4ee3\u91d1<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u3068\u3057\u3066<\/span>\u8981\u6c42\u3059\u308b\u3002<br>To demand with 200 million yen <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">as<\/span> the ransom. <br><br>56. \u72b6\u6cc1\u306f\u4e8b\u5b9f<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u3068\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046<\/span>\u3002<br>Literally: Let&#8217;s <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">have<\/span> the circumstance <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">as<\/span> being the truth. <br>Let&#8217;s posit that the circumstance is true.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Noun X + Adjective \uff08\u9023\u7528\u5f62\u30fb\uff5e\u304f\uff09\uff0b\u3059\u308b<br>Noun X \uff0b Adjective Noun \uff08\u9023\u7528\u5f62\u30fb\uff5e\u306b\uff09\uff0b\u3059\u308b<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as was the case with \u306a\u308b, the basic pattern &#8220;Noun X + Noun Y \uff0b \u306b\u3059\u308b&#8221; can be adapted so that instead of there being Noun Y, Noun X is being changed in such a way that Noun X itself is not changing, just a quality of Noun X, which is denoted by an adjective turned adverb. <br><br>To do so, we are once again conjugating the adjectives in question into their \u9023\u7528\u5f62\uff08\uff5e\u304f\uff09 to be used as adverbs.
