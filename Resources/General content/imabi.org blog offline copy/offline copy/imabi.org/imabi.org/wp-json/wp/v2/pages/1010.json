As you will learn in this lesson, it also provided&nbsp;a wealth of terminology used to further describe seasonal changes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Japan being north of the equator, it experiences four seasons&nbsp;(\u56db\u5b63) much in the same as most of Europe and Asia, although the experiences one will have with these seasons will heavily differ based on latitude. The four seasons are colloquially referred to as&nbsp;\u6625\u590f\u79cb\u51ac, but this word only scratches the surface. First, let&#8217;s look at the following key terminology. These definitions are shown to dispel any ambiguity that may occur by referring to previous coverage regarding calendar systems.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Terminology<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Season&nbsp;(\u5b63\u7bc0): One of the four seasons of Japan: \u6625\uff08\u306f\u308b\uff09, \u590f\uff08\u306a\u3064\uff09, \u79cb\uff08\u3042\u304d\uff09,&nbsp;and \u51ac\uff08\u3075\u3086\uff09 in that order.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Solar year&nbsp;(\uff08\u4e00\uff09\u592a\u967d\u5e74): The time it takes for Earth to make one full revolution around the Sun.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lunar year (\u592a\u967d\u66a6\u306e\u4e00\u5e74): Period of twelve &#8216;months&#8217; of the Moon waning and waxing.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Leap Month (\u958f\u6708): A month inserted into the lunisolar year to account for the days not accounted for by a 12 month&#8217;s worth of Moon cycles.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8216;Old Calendar&#8217; (\u65e7\u66a6): Refers to the Chinese\/Japanese lunisolar calendar, which has officially been abandoned since the introduction of the Western &#8216;solar&#8217; calendar in the late 1800s but is still maintained by many for various purposes. The influence of this &#8216;old calendar&#8217; can be witnessed whenever the &#8216;Chinese New Year&#8217; is talked about.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8216;New Calendar&#8217; (\u65b0\u66a6): Refers to the Western\/Gregorian Calendar which is based on the solar year. Jan. 1 is marked as the start of the New Year and is completely separate from the lunisolar calendar.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lunisolar calendar (\u592a\u9670\u592a\u967d\u66a6): The Chinese and Japanese iterations of the lunisolar calendar are essentially the same as the calculation differences are negligible. The innerworkings of this system tie into the season demarcations made with the 24 &#8216;solar terms&#8217; (\u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u7bc0\u6c17)&#8211;see below.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Solar term (\u7bc0\u6c17): There are 24 solar terms which divide a solar year. The use of this system allows people to know how far along the year has gone as well as what season it is.&nbsp;In this lesson, some solar terms may be specifically named and defined before the introduction of all of them to aid in better defining the seasons.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The words &#8220;old calendar,&#8221; &#8220;lunisolar calendar,&#8221; and &#8220;lunar calendar&#8221; are often used interchangeably as the minutiae between these terms don&#8217;t affect how seasonal words are used. That being said, however, the majority of this lesson will be about season words that are directly related to this &#8216;lunar&#8217; calendar.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Seasons\u3000\u56db\u5b63\u306e\u57fa\u672c\u547c\u79f0<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The words for the four seasons in Japanese should be very familiar to you as they would have been learned at the beginning of your studies. These four words&#8211;spring = \u6625\uff08\u306f\u308b\uff09,&nbsp;summer =&nbsp;\u590f\uff08\u306a\u3064\uff09, autumn =&nbsp;\u79cb\uff08\u3042\u304d\uff09, and winter&nbsp;= \u51ac\uff08\u3075\u3086\uff09&#8211;are all native words that have existed in Japanese since Old Japanese. Perhaps the only esoteric knowledge that could be had from these words alone is that \u7a50 is a rare alternative of \u79cb.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In formal\/written jargon, however, these native words do get replaced by Sino-Japanese equivalents made with their Kanji&#8217;s respective ON readings while being paired with either&nbsp;\u5b63 (season) or \u671f (time period). For instance, the Summer Olympics is officially translated as \u590f\u5b63\u30aa\u30ea\u30f3\u30d4\u30c3\u30af, although speakers would colloquially refer to it as \u590f\u306e\u30aa\u30ea\u30f3\u30d4\u30c3\u30af.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td><strong>&nbsp;\u5927\u548c\u8a00\u8449<\/strong><strong>(Generic Word)<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;\u6f22\u8a9e\uff08\uff5e\u5b63\uff09<\/strong><strong>Formal (+ Season)<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;\u6f22\u8a9e\uff08\uff5e\u671f\uff09<\/strong><strong>Formal (+Period)<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;\u6625\uff08\u306f\u308b\uff09 = Spring<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u6625\u5b63\uff08\u3057\u3085\u3093\u304d\uff09= Spring seasonEx. \u6625\u5b63\u5927\u4f1a Spring convention<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u6625\u671f\uff08\u3057\u3085\u3093\u304d\uff09= Spring periodEx. \u6625\u671f\u8b1b\u7fd2 Spring training<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u590f\uff08\u306a\u3064\uff09= Summer<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u590f\u5b63\uff08\u304b\u304d\uff09= Summer seasonEx. \u590f\u5b63\u4f11\u6687 Summer break<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u590f\u671f\uff08\u304b\u304d\uff09= Summer periodEx. \u590f\u671f\u8b1b\u5ea7 Summer-period lecture<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u79cb\uff08\u3042\u304d\uff09= Autumn<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u79cb\u5b63\uff08\u3057\u3085\u3046\u304d\uff09= Autumn seasonEx. \u79cb\u5b63\u904b\u52d5\u4f1a Fall Athletic Meet<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u79cb\u671f\uff08\u3057\u3085\u3046\u304d\uff09= Autumn periodEx. \u79cb\u671f\u9650\u5b9a Fall-limited<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u51ac\uff08\u3075\u3086\uff09= Fall<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u51ac\u5b63\uff08\u3068\u3046\u304d\uff09= Winter seasonEx. \u51ac\u5b63\u4e94\u8f2a Winter Olympics<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u51ac\u671f\uff08\u3068\u3046\u304d\uff09= Winter periodEx. \u51ac\u671f\u7df4\u7fd2 Winter-period practice<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u203bThe word \u6625\u79cb\uff08\u3057\u3085\u3093\u3058\u3085\u3046\uff09also exists, either literally meaning &#8220;spring and autumn&#8221; or referring to &#8220;years&#8221; in a broader sense.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Defining Each Season\u3000\u5404\u5b63\u7bc0\u306e\u5b9a\u7fa9<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to these words, the &#8220;four seasons&#8221; are collectively referred to as \u6625\u590f\u79cb\u51ac\uff08\u3057\u3085\u3093\u304b\u3057\u3085\u3046\u3068\u3046\uff09&nbsp;or \u56db\u5b63\uff08\u3057\u304d\uff09.&nbsp; These words are heavily used in literature, music, and day-to-day life.

In Japan, spring is known as being the months of March, April, and May. According to Western astronomy, spring starts with the spring equinox (\u6625\u5206) and ends with the summer solstice (\u590f\u81f3), but traditionally, spring coincides with the solar term \u7acb\u6625 (start of spring) and ends with the solar term \u7acb\u590f (start of summer).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Japan, spring coincides with the first quarter (\u7b2c\u4e00\u56db\u534a\u671f) of the fiscal year (\u4f1a\u8a08\u5e74\u5ea6) and the academic year (\u5b66\u6821\u5e74\u5ea6)&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the academic year, the &#8216;summer semester&#8217; (\u590f\u5b66\u671f) is from April until September, and the &#8216;winter semester&#8217; (\u51ac\u5b66\u671f) is from September until March.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring is when temperatures begin to rise, but cold days may still persist depending on region. Spring is also associated with the full-blooming (\u6e80\u958b) of many flowers.&nbsp;It is also the season in which rice planting (\u7530\u690d\u3048) begins. In countries such as the US and most of Europe, this is also when daylight saving time (\u30b5\u30de\u30fc\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0) is implemented, but Japan does not follow this convention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Defining Summer \u300c\u590f\u300d\u306e\u5b9a\u7fa9<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer is the season between spring and autumn. According to Western astronomy, summer may be defined as starting on the summer solstice (\u590f\u81f3) and ending with the autumn equinox (\u79cb\u5206).&nbsp;Since switching over to the Western solar calendar, nowadays summer encompasses June, July, and August, but when the lunar calendar was in place, it stood for Month 4, Month 5, and Month 6, starting on early May with the solar term \u7acb\u590f (start of summer)&nbsp;and ending in early August with the solar term \u7acb\u79cb (start of autumn)&#8211;see below for exact dates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer is characterized as being the hottest three months of the year, but because of the unique climate dynamics of the Japanese archipelago, the heat which is usually felt elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere during the months of June and July is hindered by the rainy season (\u6885\u96e8), resulting in peak temperatures coinciding with the beginning of autumn (\u521d\u79cb).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Japanese Meteorological Agency (\u6c17\u8c61\u5e81) defines a day as a &#8216;summer day&#8217; if the day&#8217;s high (\u6700\u9ad8\u6c17\u6e29) is 25-29\u2103 and as a &#8216;midsummer day&#8217; (\u771f\u590f\u65e5) if the high is 30-34\u2103&nbsp;or more. If the high is at or exceeds 35\u2103, it is known as a \u731b\u6691\u65e5\uff08\u3082\u3046\u3057\u3087\u3073\uff09. These days are most likely to occur in Japan in the months of August and September, which extends the definition of summer into what coincides with fall as mentioned above. The agency also defines the yearly &#8220;summer half-year&#8221; (\u6696\u5019\u671f) as occurring from April until September&#8211;coinciding with all the months in which summer-like temperatures are possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Defining Autumn \u300c\u79cb\u300d\u306e\u5b9a\u7fa9<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Autumn is the season after summer and before winter. This is the season associated with the coloring of leaves (\u7d05\u8449) and grasses withering as it gets closer to winter with the arrival of gradually colder weather. In Japan, autumn encompasses September, October, and November. Traditionally, it began with the solar term \u7acb\u79cb (start of autumn) and ended with the solar term \u7acb\u51ac (start of winter). From a Western astronomical standpoint, however, autumn may be defined as starting with the autumn equinox (\u79cb\u5206) and ending with the winter solstice (\u51ac\u81f3)&#8211;see exact dates for these solar terms below.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although summer highs may continue deep into the first month of autumn in Japan, winds do gradually pick up. September also happens to be the month with the most typhoon landfalls, which also aid in lowering temperatures, especially at night. Nights also begin getting longer throughout this season.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Defining Winter\u3000\u300c\u51ac\u300d\u306e\u5b9a\u7fa9<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In modern times, winter encompasses December, January, and February in Japan. In the &#8216;old calendar,&#8217; winter was defined as the 10th, 11th, and 12 month. Traditionally, winter began with the solar term \u7acb\u51ac (start of winter) and ended with the solar term \u7acb\u6625 (start of spring), but it is also possible to define winter as being from the &#8220;winter solstice&#8221; (\u51ac\u81f3) to the&nbsp;&#8220;spring equinox&#8221; (\u6625\u5206), which is a thought process introduced from Western astronomy&#8211;see below for exact dates of these solar terms. Either way, winter is mostly confined to the three aforementioned months of the Gregorian calendar, with the last definition extending into March.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Japanese fiscal year (\u4f1a\u8a08\u5e74\u5ea6) adds another slightly altered definition of winter, with the &#8216;winter quarter&#8217; or &#8216;fourth quarter&#8217; (\u7b2c4\u56db\u534a\u671f)&nbsp;being January, February, and March. These three months are not only the end of the fiscal year, but they are also the end of the academic year (\u5b66\u6821\u5e74\u5ea6). In the academic year, the &#8216;summer semester&#8217; (\u590f\u5b66\u671f) is from April until September, and the &#8216;winter semester&#8217; (\u51ac\u5b66\u671f) is from September until March.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Winter is known for being cold. In fact, the Japanese Meteorological&nbsp;Agency (\u6c17\u8c61\u5e81)&nbsp;defines a day as a &#8216;winter day&#8217; (\u51ac\u65e5) if the day&#8217;s low (\u6700\u4f4e\u6c17\u6e29) is 0\u2103 or below. If the day&#8217;s high (\u6700\u9ad8\u6c17\u6e29) is&nbsp;0\u2103 or below, it is called a \u771f\u51ac\u65e5 (midwinter day).&nbsp;When winter is relatively warmer than average, it is referred to as a \u6696\u51ac. The opposite sort of winter with consistently&nbsp;cold temperatures is known as \u5bd2\u51ac, and if temperatures are consistently extremely cold, then it is known as \u53b3\u51ac.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a meteorological&nbsp;perspective, winter may also be defined as starting when there is snow cover (\u7a4d\u96ea), and it may be defined as ending with the start of snow melt (\u878d\u96ea)\/thawing of ice (\u89e3\u6c37). Since winter does straddle two different years, there is also what&#8217;s known as a \u5bd2\u5019\u5e74, which defines the start of a year&#8217;s snow precipitation as beginning in August and ending on 7\/31 of the next year. So, if snow fall is recorded on Mt. Fuji on July 30th, 2021, that snowfall will be counted in 2020&#8217;s snowfall. There is also such thing as a winter half-year (\u5bd2\u5019\u671f), which lasts from October till March, which encompasses all the months in which to expect winter-like weather.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The 24 Divisions of the Solar Year\u3000\u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u7bc0\u6c17<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the Earth (\u5730\u7403) revolves (\u516c\u8ee2) around the Sun (\u592a\u967d\u306e\u5468\u308a), the Earth revolves while tilted 23.4\u00b0 on its axis (\u5730\u8ef8).&nbsp;Consequently, the Northern Hemisphere (\u5317\u534a\u7403) and the Southern Hemisphere (\u5357\u534a\u7403) alternate yearly from having the Sun being at its highest point. During the&nbsp;<strong>summer solstice<\/strong>&nbsp;(\u590f\u81f3), the Sun is at its highest in the Northern Hemisphere but at the lowest in the Southern Hemisphere; oppositely, during the&nbsp;<strong>winter solstice<\/strong>&nbsp;(\u51ac\u81f3), the Sun is at its lowest in the Northern Hemisphere but at its highest in the Southern Hemisphere.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the&nbsp;solstices, the&nbsp;equinoxes are of equal importance.&nbsp;An&nbsp;<strong>equinox<\/strong>&nbsp;(\u5206\u70b9) is the instant in when the Earth&#8217;s celestial equator (\u5929\u306e\u8d64\u9053) passes through the geometric center of the Sun&#8217;s disk (\u9ec4\u9053), which happens once in spring from south to north (\u6625\u5206\u70b9) and once in the fall from north to south (\u79cb\u5206\u70b9).

that can be derived in the lunisolar calendar: a &#8216;lunar&#8217; definition and a &#8216;solar&#8217; definition.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The definition of 1 month (1\u304b\u6708) in the&nbsp;<strong>lunar&nbsp;calendar<\/strong>&nbsp;(\u592a\u9670\u66a6) sense is based on the movement of the Moon (\u6708\u306e\u904b\u884c)&nbsp;in which the first day is the start of the New Moon (\u65b0\u6708) known as \u6714\u65e5\uff08\u3055\u304f\u3058\u3064\u30fb\u3064\u3044\u305f\u3061\uff09 and the last day of the month is known as \u6666\u65e5. This &#8216;month&#8217; definition is known as a&nbsp;<strong>\u66a6\u6708<\/strong>&nbsp;or \u6708\u5207\u308a. It is this month demarcation method which is cited in various information recorded in almanacs called \u66a6\u6ce8 (literally: &#8220;calendar notations&#8221;). The first month known as \u6b63\u6708\u30fb\u4e00\u6708 along with Month 2 and Month 3 make up spring (\u6625), Months 4~6 make up summer (\u590f), Months 7~9 make up autumn (\u79cb), and Months 10~12 make up winter (\u51ac).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the&nbsp;<strong>solar calendar<\/strong>&nbsp;(\u592a\u967d\u66a6) sense, 1 month may be determined to be from the first day of 1 &#8216;true&#8217; \u7bc0\u6c17 to the first day of the next &#8216;true&#8217; \u7bc0\u6c17. These solar terms are marked in the chart as ending in \uff5e\u6708\u7bc0. These month demarcations are known as&nbsp;<strong>\u7bc0\u6708<\/strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;\u7bc0\u5207\u308a. In Japan, this method has been favored for fortune telling,&nbsp;&nbsp;determining the timing of yearly events (\u5e74\u4e2d\u884c\u4e8b), as well as for determining when to&nbsp;use seasonal words known as \u5b63\u8a9e&#8211;especially in poetry. By this method, Month 1 starts with \u7acb\u6625 and ends with the start of \u5553\u87c4, and then so on and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, the \u4e2d\u6c17 are used as definitive points within a month to determine that it is indeed the month in question. In other words, the&nbsp;\u66a6\u6708 set the standard of the lunisolar calendar in practice. Thus, for example, \u7acb\u6625 may or may not be in Month 1 as a consequence.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although&nbsp;the lunar New Year may coincide with the start of \u7acb\u6625&#8211;known as \u6714\u65e6\u7acb\u6625\uff08\u3055\u304f\u305f\u3093\u308a\u3063\u3057\u3085\u3093\uff09&#8211;that is not a guarantee. The 11th month is defined by the winter solstice, and so the New Year falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice, and for \u7acb\u6625 to occur in the New Year, that second new moon would need to come before it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if there happens to be a new moon in the period after \u7acb\u6625 and up to \u96e8\u6c34, then \u7acb\u6625 occurs in Month 12 of the previous year&#8211;a phenomenon known as \u5e74\u5185\u7acb\u6625. If that second new moon occurs prior to \u7acb\u6625, then it&#8217;s in Month 1. At most, this makes the old calendar off by about half a month from using the \u7bc0\u5207\u308a method.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Leap Months<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8216;lunar&#8217; aspect of the \u66a6\u6708, as mentioned, follows the Moon cycle, but the waxing and waning (\u6708\u306e\u6e80\u3061\u6b20\u3051) is approximately 11 days shorter within a year than the amount of days accounted for by the 24 solar terms when using the \u7bc0\u6708 demarcation. This is apparent from how the traditional lunar New Year various from late January to mid-February in the Gregorian calendar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To compensate for this,&nbsp;&nbsp;a leap month (\u958f\u6708 \uff1d \u3046\u308b\u3046\u3065\u304d\u30fb\u3058\u3085\u3093\u3052\u3064) must be inserted at least seven times in the span of 19 years and more practically once every three years. The mechanics of when to insert a leap month (\u7f6e\u958f\u6cd5) has been shrouded in controversy for millennia, but in modern times, when a leap month has been inserted is determined prior to the publishing of that year&#8217;s calendar, so don&#8217;t stress about the math. As far as what the leap month is called, if a leap month is inserted after the lunisolar April, that leap month is called \u958f4\u6708. Thus, the exact name of the leap month is determined by the name of the preceding month. The name of the preceding month is also determined by the \u4e2d\u6c17 of that time of year, and the placement of the leap month is meant to coincide when no \u4e2d\u6c17 occurs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2021 AD&#8217;s Start Date&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Japan, the start of 2021 AD is marked by the Gregorian calendar. This is so much the case that even the term \u66a6\u6708, when in reference to the&nbsp;&#8216;new calendar&#8217; \u65b0\u66a6, no longer refers to the 30-day Moon cycle but to the Western month demarcations.
