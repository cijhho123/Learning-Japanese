For instance, even though&nbsp;<ruby>\u4f9b\u7d66<rt>\u304d\u3087\u3046\u304d\u3085\u3046<\/rt><\/ruby>&nbsp;(supply) is the opposite of&nbsp;<ruby>\u9700\u8981<rt>\u3058\u3085\u3088\u3046<\/rt><\/ruby>&nbsp;(demand), only \u4f9b\u7d66 can be followed by \u3059\u308b. This lesson will investigate what exactly the patterns are to figuring this out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Particles are also confusing. Some nouns become verbalized by adding \uff5e\u3059\u308b, \uff5e\u3092\u3059\u308b, \uff5e\u306b\u3059\u308b, \uff5e\u306b\u306a\u308b, a combination of these. This does not consider the particle to be used before the resultant verb phrase.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Initial Problems<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our first problem is when to use \uff5e\u3092\u3059\u308b as opposed to just attaching \u3059\u308b directly to the noun in question. From the very beginning of your Japanese studies, you&#8217;ve likely encountered very basic vocabulary in which this \u3092 is optional:&nbsp;\u7df4\u7fd2\uff08\u3092\uff09\u3059\u308b (to practice ) and \u52c9\u5f37\uff08\u3092\uff09\u3059\u308b (to study).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Extending \uff5e\u3092\u3059\u308b haphazardly to any \u3059\u308b verb isn&#8217;t correct, however, as there are situations in which only \uff5e\u3059\u308b or \uff5e\u3092\u3059\u308b is right.

However, the verb \u610f\u5473\u3059\u308b is not quite the same as just to define. Rather, it is more like &#8220;to imply.&#8221;<br>2. Particle omission is a common practice in casual speech, but in non-casual speech, expressions like \u30c6\u30cb\u30b9\u3059\u308b become improper.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the particle \u3092 is required, \u3059\u308b is interpreted&nbsp;literally. This \u3059\u308b is sometimes called a \u91cd\u52d5\u8a5e (heavy verb) in contrast to when it is just a grammatical item. Notice that the words that only take \u3092\u3059\u308b are&nbsp;specific&nbsp;activities: \u5f37\u76d7, \u30c6\u30cb\u30b9, \u91ce\u7403. Are these nouns then made verbs? No, they&#8217;re obligatorily marked by \u3092 and are thus functioning as direct objects.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For activity nouns that are broad in meaning such as \u52c9\u5f37 and \u7df4\u7fd2, we see that \u3092 is optional. When \u3092 is used, these nouns usually have some sort of attribute, making them more specific.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306e\u52c9\u5f37\u3092\u3059\u308b\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; To study Japanese.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Literally: To do Japanese studies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those that obligatorily only take \u3059\u308b, they all represent a state\/situation.

Ignoring set phrases that may break the rules, there are a set of tests to determine whether a noun has a high enough \u52d5\u8a5e\u6027 (verbal nature) to take \u3059\u308b.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u3059\u308b or not to \u3059\u308b<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Test 1: Aspect Modifier Test<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time phrases like \u201cuntil&#8221; (\u307e\u3067\u306b) in Japanese set aspect limitations on verbs. Aspect is the grammatical concept that denotes how a verb behaves over a duration of time. If a noun in Japanese can take a time parameter setting phrase such as \u307e\u3067\u306b, then it is said to have a high&nbsp;\u52d5\u8a5e\u6027, which means it should also have a verb form that can take those same time phrases.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2a. \u660e\u65e5\u307e\u3067\u306e\u4ed5\u4e0a\u304c\u308a\u3000\uff08Noun Phrase)\u30002b.\u3000\u660e\u65e5\u307e\u3067\u306b\u4ed5\u4e0a\u304c\u308b\u3000\uff08Verb Phrase)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Completion by tomorrow&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To complete by tomorrow<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were to replace \u4ed5\u4e0a\u304c\u308a with \u672c or \u90e8\u5c4b, which are both Sino-Japanese nouns, you do not get a valid sentence. These physical objects have nothing to do with time. Likewise, even if a noun can be about a state that may occur over a period of time, if a time parameter is not built into its meaning, producing a valid noun phrase like in 2a. will reversely be impossible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3a. \u591c\u4ee5\u5185\u306e\u75db\u307f X\u3000\u3000\u3000\u30003b.\u3000\u591c\u306e\u75db\u307f\u3000\u3007\u3000\u30003c.\u3000\u591c\u306b\u75db\u3080<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\uff5e\u4ee5\u5185 creates a time parameter in the same way the particle \u307e\u3067\u306b does.

Although nouns like \u7dca\u5f35, \u6df7\u4e71 (chaos), and \u6d41\u884c (fashion\/trend) may not necessarily have defined time frames, these stages are subject to change, and change takes time. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong>: As for \u5728\u5eab\uff08\u3092\uff09\u3059\u308b, the noun \u5728\u5eab means &#8220;stock\/inventory.&#8221; In business, doing inventory is very important, and as it is such an integral part of business, the noun \u5728\u5eab has been re-purposed to be used as a noun, even though it is viewed as a physical noun otherwise&#8211;one that does happen to change over time. Usually, being a concrete noun like \u672c (book), \u71b1 (fever), \u75c5\u9662 (hospital) would negate this test even if the noun&#8217;s state is subject to change.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Test 4: Intent\/State of Action with Adjective Modifiers Test<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still some \u3059\u308b verbs not accounted for.

Beware of influence from your native language(s) that may make you accidentally say things like \u72ec\u7acb\u306b\u306a\u308b, which should be \u72ec\u7acb\u3059\u308b (to become independent). Independence like marriage presumably lasts for some time. \u72ec\u7acb along with \u7d50\u5a5a, \u5b89\u5fc3, etc. pass Test 3 and thus have \u3059\u308b verbs. If a noun fails this test, \uff5e\u306b\u306a\u308b, \uff5e\u306b\u3059\u308b, or both might be used instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As final examples, consider \u7015\u6b7b (to become moribund) and \u4e2d\u6bd2 (intoxication\/poisoning). \u7015\u6b7b\u3059\u308b fails all tests. When verbal, you say \u7015\u6b7b\u306b\u306a\u308b, as expected. Both \u7015\u6b7b and \u4e2d\u6bd2 don&#8217;t make sense with \u201ctemporary\u201d. They describe things that simply happen\/come to be. It would be weird to say that something was moribund for several days or someone was intoxicated for two hours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Word Note<\/strong>: \u4e2d\u6bd2\u3059\u308b does exist in the transitive sense of \u201cto poison\u201d, which then passes Test 4.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Particle Note<\/strong>: The particle used before the \u3059\u308b verb is determined by the semantics of the verb phrase itself. This is not the topic of this lesson. The topic of this lesson is what sort of nouns become \u3059\u308b verbs and which ones need \u3092.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, \u3092\u656c\u793c\u3059\u308b is ungrammatical because the \u3059\u308b verb \u656c\u793c\u3059\u308b&nbsp;means &#8220;to salute&#8221;, and because you &#8220;salute to&nbsp;something&#8221;, you use the particle \u306b with it. Though not using &#8220;to&#8221; is alright in English, this is not English, so you are going to have to consider how \u656c\u793c\u3059\u308b is used and not assume it&#8217;s like its English equivalents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Examples<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After a long time studying grammar, we will end this section with example sentences with even more \u3059\u308b verbs.

Only their conjugations are tricky.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\uff5e\u305a\u308b came before \uff5e\u3058\u308b, but the latter is more common.&nbsp;\uff5e\u305a\u308b is mainly found in literature, but because they do occasionally show up, you at least need to know that you are looking at a form of \u3059\u308b and that it has a more modern equivalent, \uff5e\u3058\u308b.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u307f\u305c\u3093\u3051\u3044<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u308c\u3093\u3088\u3046\u3051\u3044<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3057\u3085\u3046\u3057\u3051\u3044<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u308c\u3093\u305f\u3044\u3051\u3044<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3044\u305c\u3093\u3051\u3044<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3081\u3044\u308c\u3044\u3051\u3044<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\uff5e\u3058\u308b&nbsp;<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3058-<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3058-<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3058\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3058\u308b-<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3058\u308c-<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3058\u308d\u30fb\u3058\u3088<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\uff5e\u305a\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305c\u30fb\u3058-<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3058-<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305a\uff08\u308b\uff09<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305a\u308b-<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305a\u308c-<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305c\u3088<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Base Note<\/strong>: Like \u3059\u308b, \u305c is used with older endings.
