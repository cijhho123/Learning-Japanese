This results in interchangeability between the two particles in this context. Typically, unless emphasis is intended on the &#8220;source&#8221; of the matter, \u306b is preferred. This becomes problematic with the verb for &#8220;to receive&#8221; in Japanese, as in English, &#8220;from&#8221; is the go-to preposition, which imposes emphasis on who the giver is upon receiving something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>43. \u5f7c\u6c0f\uff5b\u304b\u3089\u30fb\u306b\uff5d\u30d7\u30ec\u30bc\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u3082\u3089\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>I received a gift from my boyfriend. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Various factors affect which particle is ultimately most natural in this environment, and so we will revisit the topic <a href=\"https:\/\/imabi.org\/%e3%83%8b%e6%a0%bc-vs-%e3%82%ab%e3%83%a9%e6%a0%bc\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"356\">later<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Source = Cause\/Judgment Calls<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another application of the case particle \u304b\u3089 is indicating the &#8220;source&#8221; (cause) of some result or judgment call.

As the object is not quite a starting point of separation for the agent, and because the agent is not necessarily even physically removed from the object, \u304b\u3089 is not the appropriate particle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s look at some sentences in which \u3092\u30fb\u304b\u3089 are more or less interchangeable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>48. \u5148\u307b\u3069\u7fbd\u7530\u7a7a\u6e2f\uff5b\u3092\u30fb\u304b\u3089\uff5d\u767a\u3061\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I departed (from) Haneda Airport shortly ago. <br><br>49. \u30b9\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u7559\u5b66\u4ee5\u6765\u3001\u5144\u306f\u3057\u3070\u3089\u304f\u5bb6\u65cf\uff5b\u3092\u30fb\u304b\u3089 \uff5d\u96e2\u308c\u3066\u66ae\u3089\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>Since studying abroad in Spain, my older brother has been living away from our family for a while. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Ex. 48, the use of \u304b\u3089 indicates that the agent&#8217;s departure on a journey began at the airport, while the use of \u3092 simply indicates the airport as a point of departure. In this circumstance, the nuancing is negligible. Meanwhile, in Ex. 49, what is meant by &#8220;family&#8221; can have a significant effect on the emotional take from the sentence. By using \u304b\u3089, the physical distance separating the family from the brother is heightened, but by using \u3092, the image of &#8220;family&#8221; becomes abstract and loaded with emotion as an effect, as the separation is felt as a consequence of &#8220;leaving the family&#8221; being a transition point in the brother&#8217;s life.   <\/p>\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-footnotes\"><li id=\"3b146144-a467-48b6-89e9-f8e365c7952d\">In English, the preposition &#8220;in&#8221; is used instead of &#8220;from&#8221; because the sun is not moving.
