Of course, you must realize that these words have different politeness implications.

Essentially, any response from another person to keep the conversation going and making the transitions in details more natural is an \u76f8\u69cc. The typical Japanese way of explaining starts out broad and then getting to details by the end.

You can just imagine the change of facial expressions by Speaker A. The problem is that light \u76f8\u69cc can let you get out of a conversation quicker. If in a situation like this where the more courteous thing is to extend the conversation, then you should do so. It&#8217;s only proper.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to really try to do is pay close attention to what the speaker says at the very beginning of the conversation so that you can have an attempt at being able to repeat certain parts or ask questions about it. Adding opinion or emotion like surprise or disbelief is much better than being silent. Be natural, though. It&#8217;s best to give a small pause to sound more natural.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When repeating what the other person says, feel free to change up the sentence endings to show an appropriate reaction. You don&#8217;t want to sound like a robot or like you can&#8217;t relate. Even adding a question after giving an appropriate reaction is good too.
