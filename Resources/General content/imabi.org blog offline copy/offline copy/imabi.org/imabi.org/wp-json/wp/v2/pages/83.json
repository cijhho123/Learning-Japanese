Among these, &#8220;case particles&#8221; (<ruby>\u683c\u52a9\u8a5e<rt>\u304b\u304f\u3058\u3087\u3057<\/rt><\/ruby>) are particularly important. While they are somewhat analogous to English prepositions, they do not align perfectly with them, nor does English have a preposition for every Japanese case particle. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Case?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Case refers to the grammatical function a noun plays in a sentence. For this lesson, we will focus on one of the most important grammatical functions: the subject, which is marked by the case particle \u304c.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u304c\u2260\u306f<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, we have not encountered the case particle \u304c, even in the Japanese iteration of the basic sentence pattern &#8220;X is Y,&#8221; but ironically, \u304c is more fundamental to the grammar of basic sentence structures in Japanese than the particle \u306f which has been seen. <br><br>Whereas \u304c&#8217;s role is defined by the grammatical function it marks, \u306f&#8217;s role is tied to the commentary that is lived out in the surrounding context. The importance of this relationship will become clearer as you become familiarized with them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Terminology Recap<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before diving into the main discussion, let\u2019s review the essential grammar terms you will need to understand as we move forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Subject:&nbsp;<\/strong><em>The person\/thing&nbsp;that performs an action (with verb predicates) or is what exhibits a certain state (with adjectival\/adjectival-noun predicates).<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Predicate<\/strong>:&nbsp;<em>The part of a sentence that makes a statement about the subject.&nbsp;<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Copula<\/strong>:&nbsp;<em>A word used to link the subject and predicate of a sentence.<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Noun<\/strong>:&nbsp;<em>In its most basic definition, a word that refers to a person, place, thing, event, substance, or quality.&nbsp;<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Adjective<\/strong>:<em>&nbsp;A word that describes a state and may constitute the predicate at the end of a sentence or be a part of a noun-predicate if it is the modifier.&nbsp;<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Verb<\/strong>:<em>&nbsp;A word that describes an action, state, or occurrence.

This information is then distilled to the listener as new information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This distinction helps \u304c serve as an objective means for:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Making neutral statements.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Providing answers to questions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Asking direct questions such as &#8220;What is\u2026?&#8221; or &#8220;Who is\u2026?&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to these purposes, \u304c is commonly seen in sentences involving:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Statements of existence<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The five senses<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Simple intransitive verbs (verbs that do not take objects)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Spontaneous remarks<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>To tackle all of these contexts in the simplest yet logically sound fashion possible, we will investigate these environments based on how they relate to each other. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New Information<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas the main purpose of&nbsp;\u306f is to topicalize something to bring attention to the comment that follows, the particle&nbsp;\u304c is used mostly to present new information. In doing so, the statements can be neutral or biased. First, we will investigate the neutral-leaning contexts in which \u304c appears. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Existential Sentences<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Neutral statements describe states and or actions. They form the objective truth of the recent past, the present, or the future. In doing so, existential sentences are the simplest to understand and form. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Existential sentences are statements that indicate the existence of something. These sentences often include additional information, such as location. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In English, the subject of an existential sentence is the dummy pronoun &#8220;there,&#8221; while the thing that exists is treated as the object:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>i.&nbsp;<strong>There<\/strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<em>dog<\/em>&nbsp;in the yard.<br>ii.&nbsp;<strong>There<\/strong>&nbsp;are&nbsp;<em>oranges<\/em>&nbsp;on the table.<br>iii. <strong>There<\/strong> is not a <em>dragon<\/em> here.<br>iv. <strong>There <\/strong>are not any <em>pens<\/em> in the room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Japanese, however, the thing that exists is treated as the subject, and existence is expressed using specific verbs:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>\u3042\u308b: Used for non-living (inanimate) objects.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u3044\u308b: Used for living (animate) beings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In Lesson 11, we learned how the copula is used in X\u306fY\uff5b\u3060\u30fb\u3067\u3059\uff5d when English uses &#8220;there is&#8230;&#8221; to state that something exists in a particular situation, but to simply state that something exists, X\u304c\uff5b\u3042\u308b\u30fb\u3044\u308b\uff5d is used instead. <br><br>1. <ruby>\u98f4<rt>\u3042\u3081<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002<br>There is candy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <ruby>\u925b\u7b46<rt>\u3048\u3093\u3074\u3064<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002<br>There is\/are pencil(s).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <ruby>\u9ce5<rt>\u3068\u308a<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c\u3044\u308b\u3002<br>There is\/are (a) bird(s).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <ruby>\u725b<rt>\u3046\u3057<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c\u3044\u308b\u3002<br>There is\/are (a) cow(s).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Animacy of the subject<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Animacy is a grammatical notion that pertains to how alive or sentient an object is perceived, and it is this feature that is used to differentiate between \u3042\u308b and \u3044\u308b. <br><br>With living, animate things, \u3044\u308b is used. Sentient status is broadly applied to all animals in Japanese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. <ruby>\u733f<rt>\u3055\u308b<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c\u3044\u308b\u3002<br>There is\/are (a) monkey(s). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While still alive, things like &#8220;trees&#8221; are not deemed to be animate. Their stationary existence makes them likened to any other inanimate object. As such, they are not deemed to be sentient in Japanese grammar and are thus paired with \u3042\u308b.<br><br>6. <ruby>\u6728<rt>\u304d<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002<br>There is\/are (a) tree(s).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Living things die. Once they die, they lose their animacy. Thus, Ex. 7 specifically refers to a dead fish, and while the fish&#8217;s dead status is understood by the use of \u3042\u308b, the practical reason for why a speaker would utter this phrase would instead be to imply that the &#8220;fish&#8221; is being treated as a foodstuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. <ruby>\u9b5a<rt>\u3055\u304b\u306a<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002<br>There is\/are (a) fish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Adding Location to an Existential Sentence<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In existential sentences, the location of the subject is marked by the case particle \u306b, which corresponds to the English prepositions &#8220;in&#8221; and &#8220;on.&#8221; In Japanese, location typically takes precedence over the subject, resulting in the location marked by \u306b typically appearing before the subject of existence marked by \u304c. Ultimately, exact placement is determined by whatever order of information best reflects the ranking of importance those said elements have to the speaker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. \u3042\u305d\u3053\u306b<ruby>\u5b66\u6821<rt>\u304c\u3063\u3053\u3046<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002<br>There is a school over there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9. <ruby>\u90e8\u5c4b<rt>\u3078\u3084<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306b<ruby>\u732b<rt>\u306d\u3053<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c\u3044\u308b\u3002<br>There is\/are (a) cat(s) in the room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10. <ruby>\u673a<rt>\u3064\u304f\u3048<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e<ruby>\u4e0a<rt>\u3046\u3048<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306b<ruby>\u672c<rt>\u307b\u3093<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002<br>There is\/are a book(s) on top of the desk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11. \u30c6\u30fc\u30d6\u30eb\u306e<ruby>\u4e0b<rt>\u3057\u305f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306b\u30cd\u30ba\u30df\u304c\u3044\u308b\u3002<br>There is\/are (a) mouse\/mice underneath the table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12. <ruby>\u6a4b<rt>\u306f\u3057<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e<ruby>\u96a3<rt>\u3068\u306a\u308a<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306b<ruby>\u6edd<rt>\u305f\u304d<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002<br>There is a waterfall next to the bridge.<br><br>13. <ruby>\u56f3\u66f8\u9928<rt>\u3068\u3057\u3087\u304b\u3093<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c<ruby>\u4e2d<rt>\u306a\u304b<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306b\u3042\u308b\u3002<br>A library is inside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Neutral states w\/ adjectival\/Adjectival-Noun Predicates<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While neutral states often pertain to existence, the next most common scenario involves making a comment about how something is.

The actions that we will be looking at constitute intransitive verbs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intransitive verbs are verbs that describe actions (phenomena) that occur. For the purpose of this discussion, we will only be looking at intransitive verbs which lack a willful agent (doer).

By exclusively being the subject which makes the statement true, all other options in the speaker&#8217;s mind have been &#8220;exhaustively listed&#8221; and canceled out. Also, for the speaker to go out of their way to say that &#8220;X IS (WHAT IS) Y,&#8221; the statement must be intrinsically true. <br><br>Isolated sentences using this nuance can, at times, be difficult to identify.
