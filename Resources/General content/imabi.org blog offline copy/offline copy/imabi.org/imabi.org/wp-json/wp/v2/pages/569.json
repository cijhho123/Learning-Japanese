First, let&#8217;s consider how the following polite forms of \u65b0\u3057\u3044 differ. <br><br>8a. \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059<br>8b. \u65b0\u3057\u3044\u306e\u3067\u3059<br>8c. \u65b0\u3057\u304f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059<br>8d. \u65b0\u3057\u3085\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059<br><br>8a. In Modern Standard Japanese, this is the only practical means of rendering an adjective in polite speech (\u4e01\u5be7\u8a9e).  Whereas verbal etymology produced \uff5e\u307e\u3059<sup data-fn=\"223013e8-2c38-4731-b50c-105a4cb5ee0c\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#223013e8-2c38-4731-b50c-105a4cb5ee0c\" id=\"223013e8-2c38-4731-b50c-105a4cb5ee0c-link\">3<\/a><\/sup> for verbs, for much of Japanese history, \uff5e\u3054\u3056\u308b after the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 aided adjectives in becoming honorific, which is rendered as 8d in today&#8217;s speech. <br>8b. Though viewed as the simplest means of &#8216;correcting&#8217; 8b, the use of [nominalized clause + copular verb] is not synonymous with the basic means of creating a declarative sentence. Thus, of these forms, 8b is not fully synonymous with the other three.<br>8c. Though plausible, it is usually the case that adverbial particles such as \u306f\u30fb\u3082 intervene between the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 and \u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059 to sound natural. If, however, the sentence becomes negative, we do see that \uff5e\u304f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093 is perfectly viable and natural. <br>8d. Though grammatically sound, its politeness is far higher than 8a. Aside from set phrases, the use of \uff5e\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059 with adjectives has essentially disappeared in modern speech. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option to avoid the politeness marker \uff5e\u3067\u3059 is paraphrasing. Although paraphrasing would force the speaker to put more thought into their utterances, this is not a legitimate reason for why \uff5e\u3067\u3059 ought to be viewed as a mistake. Consider the following three phrases. All three indicate the speaker&#8217;s desire of describing how hot it is outside, but they are by no means synonymous. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9a. \u6691\u3044\u4e00\u65e5\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3000<br>It has been a hot day.<br>9b. \u6691\u304f\u306a\u3063\u3066\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u306d\u3002<br>It sure has gotten hot, hasn&#8217;t it?<br>9c. \u6691\u304f\u611f\u3058\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>It feels hot (out). <br><br>Another minor argument as to why \uff5e\u3067\u3059 ought not to be used is on the grounds of how it is less polite than other viable options. Though this is in line with the reasoning behind Ex. 8d, these speakers are specifically referring to \uff5e\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3059, which <em>can<\/em> just as easily be rendered as \uff5e\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093. <br><br>10a. \u82f1\u8a9e\u306e\u6388\u696d\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u304f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>10b. \u82f1\u8a9e\u306e\u6388\u696d\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u304f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304b\u3002<br>Is English class not hard?<br><br>The argument that 10a is ungrammatical because 10b is more formal is not the correct argument to make. Instead, making sure that a learner knows when to use each level of politeness would be far more practical and reflective of how Japanese is used. <br><br>Lastly, others note the relative absence of the politeness marker \uff5e\u3067\u3059 in formal writing, but this again would require ignoring the reality that many aspects of spoken language are not reflected in the written language and vice versa. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Use of \uff5e\u305f\u3067\u3059<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The grammaticality of the politeness marker \uff5e\u3067\u3059 following the \u7d42\u6b62\u5f62 of the past tense auxiliary verb \uff5e\u305f must be examined on an individual basis regarding the part of speech involved in the conjugation&#8217;s construction.<br><br>\u2460\u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e\uff0b\uff5e\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059<br>\u2461\u540d\u8a5e\u30fb\u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e\uff0b\uff5e\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059<br>\u2462\u52d5\u8a5e\uff0b\uff5e\u305f\u3067\u3059<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u2460\u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e\uff0b\uff5e\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Though \uff5e\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f would still be the direct predecessor of contemporary polite speech rendering of adjectives in past tense, the use of \uff5e\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059 does not get marked as being ungrammatical in the same way other uses of the politeness marker \uff5e\u3067\u3059 are. <br><br>11a. \u6771\u91ce\u3055\u3093\u304c\u66f8\u3044\u305f\u6587\u7ae0\u306f\u5927\u5909\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>11b. \u6771\u91ce\u3055\u3093\u304c\u66f8\u3044\u305f\u6587\u7ae0\u306f\u5927\u5909\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3085\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>The passage Higashino-san wrote was incredibly wonderful. <br><br>Neither sentence is ungrammatical in Modern Japanese, although as mentioned before, all usage of the auxiliary \uff5e\u3054\u3056\u308b to render adjectives in polite\/honorific speech has practically fallen out of use outside set phrases. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u2461\u540d\u8a5e\u30fb\u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e\uff0b\uff5e\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Instances of \u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e\uff0b\uff5e\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059 have become noticeable in the spoken language in the past few decades, though it has not reached the threshold of becoming grammatical by the majority of native speakers.

At first glance, it even appears to break the norm of politeness being stated after tense, not the other way around.<br><br>The main reason for why \uff5e\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f is grammatical is because \uff5e\u307e\u305b\u3093 is not being used here in its \u7d42\u6b62\u5f62: it is being used in its \u9023\u4f53\u5f62. This is proven by the existence of its intermediary rendition \uff5e\u307e\u305b\u306c\u3067\u3057\u305f, which is found in Early Modern Japanese as well as the speech of older generations. <br><br>As for why politeness is seen marked in this structure before tense, we must first understand that the emergence of the politeness marker \uff5e\u3067\u3059 itself is still a relatively new phenomenon, and while it does see varying acceptance after the non-past tense of adjectives and the past tense of adjectives, the norm still remains that politeness is typically marked first in Japanese grammar, as is demonstrated by the form \u3067\u3057\u305f when \/desu\/ does behave as a popular copular verb as well as by the pattern \uff5e\u307e\u3057\u305f. Secondly, \uff5e\u307e\u3059 for most of its history retained a much higher level of humility, and its use as a mere politeness-marking auxiliary is also a relatively new invent. <br><br>18. \u6c7d\u8239\u306e\u8f38\u9001\u529b\u306f\u3001\u958b\u6226\u5f53\u521d\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u8239\u8179\u306e\u6982\u306d\u56db\u5206\u306e\u4e00\u3092\u4fdd\u6301\u3059\u308b\u306b\u904e\u304e\u307e\u305b\u306c\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>Steam boat transport capacity only maintained approximately 1\/4th of the usable ships at the start of the war.<br><br>19. \u602a\u6211\u4eba\u306f\u3044\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>No one was injured.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Non-Zero Conjugational Power of <br>\uff5e\u3067\u3059<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although \uff5e\u3067\u3059 is viewed solely as a politeness marker, that does not mean it is void of conjugational power.
