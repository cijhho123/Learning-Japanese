However, if \u3068\u3093\u3067\u3082\u306a\u3044 instead derives from \u3068\u3093\u3060, that would render &#8211;<em>nai<\/em> as the intensifier suffix &#8211;<em>nai<\/em>, the mysterious overarching focus of the lesson to be discussed next, rendering these new polite forms invalid.<br><br>Another aspect yet mentioned is the semantic argument for why \u3068\u3093\u3067\u3082\uff5b\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u30fb\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u305b\u3093\uff5d are valid as opposed to the syntactical argument against their validity. Though the core definition of \u3068\u3093\u3067\u3082\u306a\u3044 is &#8220;outrageous&#8221; in a rather negative tone, when used as an interjection, it is often used in the sense of &#8220;oh, it&#8217;s nothing\/don&#8217;t mention it\/not at all!&#8221; and just as how the English equivalents are used, the expression is clearly used lightheartedly to reject that something is such a big deal. Some may argue that depicting a scenario serious to the listener as not being so goes against the grain in terms of how honorific speech should be carried out. Nonetheless, the sheer lack of malice intent,  if not the extension of relief had by the speaker to the listener by using this phrase, prevents this from being a practical excuse against their use.  <br><br>This, though, causes us to view \u3068\u3093\u3067\u3082\u306a\u3044 in terms of what the circumstance at hand is.

This is presumably true, which is evident from various word pairs in which the one with &#8211;<em>nai<\/em> is clearly the most emphatic. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most classic example of this is \u5fd9\uff08\u305b\u308f\uff09\u3057\u3044 vs&nbsp;<ruby>\u5fd9<\/ruby>\uff08\u305b\u308f\uff09\u3057\u306a\u3044.
