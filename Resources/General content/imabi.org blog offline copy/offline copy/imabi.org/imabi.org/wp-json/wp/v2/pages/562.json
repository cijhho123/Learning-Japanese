In fact, this process is very common, which may lead to confusion on the part of the learner to figure out the nuance differences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A perfect example that can be seen early on in studying Japanese is \u9752\u3044\u7a7a vs. \u9752\u7a7a. For the most part, either can be used to refer to the sky when it is clear and blue. However, sometimes the night sky may have a bluish haze. In this situation, one would describe the sky as \u9752\u3044\u591c\u7a7a but never as \u9752\u591c\u7a7a. In this case, the combination of \u591c and \u7a7a\u00a0is parallel to \u9752\u7a7a, preventing another modification to be connected directly without the intervention of \/i\/.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other instances, the differences are greater. Consider \u53e4\u3044\u65b0\u805e vs \u53e4\u65b0\u805e. Imagine going into a library. You head to the newspaper section. In addition to &#8216;new&#8217; newspapers from that morning, there are newspapers that have yesterday&#8217;s date and all the way back to the 1800s. The &#8216;old&#8217; newspapers displayed are referred to as \u53e4\u3044\u65b0\u805e. Now, imagine the same library having a policy that one must place &#8216;used&#8217; newspapers in a recycling bin to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Even if that newspaper was from that day, it is now a \u53e4\u65b0\u805e. In Japanese-English dictionaries, this word form is translated simply as &#8220;old newspaper(s),&#8221; making it impossible for the learner to discover this nuancing. It may even be tempting to paraphrase the translation to &#8220;used newspaper,&#8221; but this could have alternatively been phrased in Japanese as \u4f7f\u7528\u6e08\u307f\u306e\u65b0\u805e. However, just as in English, what one means by &#8220;old&#8221; clearly may vary, and in the case of Japanese, a grammatical consequence can be observed<sup data-fn=\"1c829c0c-782a-4b39-8623-7cd01d0172b2\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#1c829c0c-782a-4b39-8623-7cd01d0172b2\" id=\"1c829c0c-782a-4b39-8623-7cd01d0172b2-link\">1<\/a><\/sup>. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Discerning the Differences\u3000<br>\u9055\u3044\u306e\u898b\u5206\u3051\u65b9<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Discerning the difference between &#8220;adjectival stem + noun&#8221; and &#8220;adjective + noun<br>&#8221; word pairs requires case-by-case analyses. Generally speaking, though, an &#8220;adjectival stem + noun&#8221; compound will have a more limited meaning. However, overlap such as is the case with \u9752\u3044\u7a7a vs. \u9752\u7a7a may still occur.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1a. \u9234\u6728\u306f\u5148\u65e5\u3001\u53e4\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u9aa8\u8463\u54c1\u5e97\u3067\u8cfc\u5165\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>The other day, Suzuki purchased an antique watch at an antique\u00a0store.<br>1b. \u9234\u6728\u306f\u5148\u65e5\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u3044\u304f\u3064\u304b\u8001\u8217\u3067\u8cb7\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>The other day, Suzuki bought several old watches at an old shop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference between \u53e4\u6642\u8a08\uff08\u3075\u308b\u3069\u3051\u3044\uff09 and \u53e4\u3044\u6642\u8a08 is obvious from the difference in translation between 1a and 1b. We see that the former is limited to watches of value. However, value is determined by the eye of the beholder. To capture how this may differ, the wording of each sentence is slightly altered to reflect the mindset one might have when uttering either phrase. The value of the &#8220;old watch&#8221; found by the speaker in 1a. is amplified by how the store and the purchasing act are described. Oppositely, in 1b, the speaker describes the shop as being one that has been in town for a long time. Its merchandise, consequently, may not necessarily be stocked with high-price items. The watches purchased are simply no longer new, but they are useable. An antique watch, on the other hand, may not be useable but could still fetch a high price depending on its history.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2a. \u795e\u7530\u795e\u4fdd\u753a\u306b\u306f\u53e4\u3044\u672c\u5c4b\u304c\u305f\u304f\u3055\u3093\u3042\u308b\u3002<br>There are a lot of old bookstores in Kandajinbo Town.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2b. \u53e4\u672c\u5c4b\u3067\u53e4\u66f8\u3092\u3044\u3063\u3071\u3044\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u304d\u305f\u3002<br>I&#8217;ve just come from having bought a ton of old books from a secondhand bookstore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there are a bookstore that has been in your town for years? Even when a major retailer comes in, it may still be a well-known establishment in the community. One may call that bookstore a \u53e4\u3044\u672c\u5c4b. Have you ever, though, gone to a bookstore which specializes in rare or classic texts? Maybe it is a used bookstore? In either of these two cases, that store may be described in Japanese as a \u53e4\u672c\u5c4b.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2b., we also see the phrase \u53e4\u66f8 used. This is a Sino-Japanese compound created from the same principles as what we have been looking at. \u53e4\u66f8 specifically refers to &#8220;classics&#8221; and cannot be used to refer to a book that has simply become old. Such a book would need to be described as \u53e4\u672c\uff08\u3075\u308b\u307b\u3093\uff09. If you use a dictionary to look this up, you will also find that \u53e4\u672c may also be read as \u3053\u307b\u3093 with the specific meaning of a book whose transcription date is old. Though this word is not common in the spoken language, it fall in the semantic realm of\uff08\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\uff09\u53e4\u3044\u672c, circling back to the dynamic at hand once more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Example Sentences\u3000\u4f8b\u6587<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s summarize the observations that we have made thus far:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.\u00a0 &#8220;Adjectival stem + noun&#8221; compounds tend to have more specific meanings than &#8220;adjective + noun&#8221; phrases.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. &#8220;Adjectival stem + noun&#8221; compounds often result in \u9023\u6fc1 so long as the conditions for it are met: both elements being treated as native vocabulary words at the syntactic level, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.
