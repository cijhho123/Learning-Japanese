V<sub>1<\/sub> (\u524d\u9805\u52d5\u8a5e) of a compound always appears in the \u9023\u7528\u5f62, while V<sub>2<\/sub> (\u5f8c\u9805\u52d5\u8a5e) of a compound is what handles the conjugating capacity of the phrase as a whole. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Transitivity w\/ \u4e0a\u304c\u308b &amp; \u4e0a\u3052\u308b<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To figure out whether a compound verb is transitive or intransitive, understanding  meanings of both V<sub>1<\/sub> and V<sub>2<\/sub> is crucial, as the transitivity of both in isolation can tell a lot about the verbs.

The rain ended (ushering in clear weather). <br><br>While both verbs are possible in Ex. 11, 11b. specifically implies that the weather&#8217;s condition has improved to clearer weather.

Another more peculiar reason for why Ex. 13a. is unnatural to many speakers actually comes from how \u4e0a\u304c\u308b has been adapted to referring to going home once work is done (for the day). The same can be said for &#8220;to be done with work&#8221; in English. <br><br>14. \u4e0a\u304c\u3063\u3066OK\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>It&#8217;s okay for you to be done (for the day). <br><br>15. \u4ed5\u4e8b\u3092\u4e0a\u304c\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>I&#8217;m done with work. <br><br>The use of the particle \u3092 here is parallel with how it is used with \u7d42\u308f\u308b, making \u4e0a\u304c\u308b a quasi-transitive verb for &#8220;to end&#8221; in a less direct way that would necessarily imply the work is over for good. As this contradicts the original meaning of \u4e0a\u304c\u308b, some speakers find this to be a neologism at best.

The fireworks were set off.<br><br>The reason for why a not so small majority of people find Ex. 50a unnatural may, in fact, be how the agency of the act of launching (fireworks, a rocket, etc.) implies. While it is fairly common for there to be an intransitive means of rewriting a transitive expression to not emphasize the agent&#8217;s role, such rewrites predicate that the action be capable of occurring as happenstance, or presented as happenstance so as not to put responsibility for the action on anyone&#8217;s shoulders. The latter condition is what controls many such rewrites when speech register dynamics are at work (Ex. 40 from above). <br><br>By favoring the passive form of the transitive \u6253\u3061\u4e0a\u3052\u308b\u2014\u6253\u3061\u4e0a\u3052\u3089\u308c\u308b\u2014the predicate may still return to an intransitive state while explicitly referencing the agent&#8217;s role. <br><br>Statistically, very few instances of V<sub>1<\/sub> (trans.) + \uff5e\u4e0a\u304c\u308b exist, and for those that do, a naturally progression to an ultimately completed (improved) state is implied (see below). Here, \u6253\u3061\u4e0a\u304c\u308b only pertains to upward motion, and the force by which \u6253\u3064 occurs happens to necessitate an agent. This can also be proved by the fact that the noun form for &#8220;launch&#8221; itself is \u6253\u3061\u4e0a\u3052 and not \u6253\u3061\u4e0a\u304c\u308a<sup data-fn=\"dda167cc-e2ad-4586-bc2a-0483fa09f297\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#dda167cc-e2ad-4586-bc2a-0483fa09f297\" id=\"dda167cc-e2ad-4586-bc2a-0483fa09f297-link\">3<\/a><\/sup>.<br><br>51. \u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u6253\u3061\u4e0a\u3052\u5f8c\u30011\u6bb5\u76ee\u304c\u5206\u96e2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3082\u306e\u306e2\u6bb5\u76ee\u306e\u98db\u884c\u9014\u4e2d\u3067\u505c\u6b62\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u4f5c\u52d5\u3057\u3066\u843d\u4e0b\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>After launch, the first stage of the rocket separated, but the second stage&#8217;s shutdown system was activated mid-flight, which resulted in it coming down.<br><br>Interestingly, when agency is not so important when \u6253\u3061\u4e0a\u304c\u308b means &#8220;to be washed up (ashore),&#8221; we find that \u6253\u3061\u4e0a\u304c\u308b\u30fb\u6253\u3061\u4e0a\u3052\u3089\u308c\u308b are rather interchangeable, with the latter&#8217;s agent being the ocean itself. <br><br>52. \uff12\u982d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u304c\u540c\u6642\u306b\u6d77\u5cb8\u306b\u6253\u3061\u4e0a\u304c\u308b\u4e8b\u4f8b\u306f\u73cd\u3057\u3044\u3002<br>It is rare for two or more whales to wash up on the shore at the same time.<br><br>53. \u5148\u6708\uff12\uff19\u65e5\u306b\u30af\u30b8\u30e9\uff14\u982d\u304c\u6253\u3061\u4e0a\u3052\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3002<br>Four whales washed up on shore on the 29th of last month.<br><br>In speaking of non-human agents, even slight emphasis on said agent can bring about this difference between non-transitive vs transitive passive in other \uff5e\u4e0a\u304c\u308b\u30fb\u4e0a\u3052\u308b pairs.<br><br>54. \u653e\u5c04\u80fd\u3092\u542b\u3093\u3060\u571f\u57c3\u304c\u821e\u3044\u4e0a\u304c\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>Radioactive dust blew up into the air.<br><br>55. \u6c17\u6e29\u306e\u4e0a\u6607\u3068\u98a8\u304c\u5f37\u307e\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u3001\u6628\u65e5\u306e\u5927\u91cf\u98db\u6563\u3067\u5730\u9762\u306b\u843d\u3061\u305f\u82b1\u7c89\u304c\u821e\u3044\u4e0a\u3052\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3002(agent = \u98a8)<br>Pollen that had fallen to the ground during yesterday&#8217;s massive pollen count was whirled up by rising temperatures and the winds strengthening. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u3053\u307f\u4e0a\u3052\u308b is Intransitive?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The verb \u8fbc\u3080\u30fb\u6df7\u3080, with various meanings such as &#8220;to be crowded &#8221; and &#8220;to go into,&#8221; is intransitive, yet it is used with \uff5e\u4e0a\u3052\u308b to produce a compound verb which refers to surging of emotions, <em>as if adding agency<\/em> to the emotions themselves.
