What may come as a surprise is that the usages discussed in this lesson are all etymologically tied to the word \u76ee with the primary meaning of &#8220;eye,&#8221; which also explains why it is an appropriate spelling for all its usages. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u79e4\u306e\u76ee \u2192 Unit of Measure \u2192 Sequence<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The ability of \uff5e\u3081 to denote ordinal numbers ultimately derives from the phrase \u79e4\u306e\u76ee meaning &#8220;mark&#8221; on a device to measure length\/weight. Just how &#8220;eyeing&#8221; it can be used as a means of indicating measure in English, this is precisely how \u76ee has found itself in many &#8220;weight&#8221; related words such as \u91cf\u76ee (weight from a scale), \u76ee\u65b9 (quantity that has been &#8220;weighed out&#8221;), etc. This even produced the weight measure word \u5301\uff08\uff1d\u6587\u76ee<sup data-fn=\"8a6c31a7-d8c0-41a6-acc2-8fb15c0efd76\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#8a6c31a7-d8c0-41a6-acc2-8fb15c0efd76\" id=\"8a6c31a7-d8c0-41a6-acc2-8fb15c0efd76-link\">1<\/a><\/sup>\uff09, which was equivalent to 3.75 grams.

For instance, when demarcating a quantity of years, \uff13\u5e74\u76ee would be an &#8220;amount of three years accounted for,&#8221; which we understand to mean &#8220;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">third<\/span> year.&#8221; This is the basis for how and why \uff5e\u3081 denotes cardinal numbers with all counters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u8272\u9055\u3044\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u3092\u30b2\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u3066\u304b\u3089\uff13\uff10\u5339\u76ee\u3067\u3059\uff01\uff01<br>I was able to catch a shiny Pok\u00e9mon!
