The only difference between these sets was that \u30c2 and \u30c5 retained a plosive onset. <br><br>Indeed, as early as 1251, cases of interchangeability between [\u30b8 and \u30c2] and [\u30ba and \u30c5] began to appear, as indicated by the word for &#8220;whale&#8221; being spelled as either \u30af\u30b8\u30e9 or \u30af\u30c2\u30e9 in the \u89b3\u667a\u9662\u672c\u300e\u985e\u805a\u540d\u7fa9\u6284\u300f. <br><br>In Early Modern Japanese, the fricatives \u30b8 and \u30ba obligatorily became affricates in word-initial position and after the uvular \/N\/. In word-medial position, interchangeability between [\u30b8 and \u30c2] and [\u30ba and \u30c5] could still be heard, with the affricate pronunciations and spellings being favored for when they were deemed etymologically necessary<sup data-fn=\"16e0861e-5fba-40bb-a0b9-7c3c567274e2\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#16e0861e-5fba-40bb-a0b9-7c3c567274e2\" id=\"16e0861e-5fba-40bb-a0b9-7c3c567274e2-link\">5<\/a><\/sup>. In Modern Japanese, the internal distinctions between [\u30b8 and \u30c2] and [\u30ba and \u30c5] have become neutralized. Meaning, native speakers of the dialects affected, the most important being Standard Japanese itself, cannot differentiate them, even though phonological environment may still favor one pronunciation over the other. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yotsugana Interchangeability<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With interchangeability having existed between [\u30b8 and \u30c2] and [\u30ba and \u30c5] for centuries, it should come as no surprise that several attempts have been made to standardize spellings, though this would inherently require favoring one dialect over all others. <br><br>The first book to standardize Yotsugana spellings was the 1695\u00a0<ruby>\u8706<rt>\u3051\u3093<\/rt>\u7e2e<rt>\u3057\u3085\u304f<\/rt>\u6dbc<rt>\u308a\u3087\u3046<\/rt>\u9f13<rt>\u3053<\/rt>\u96c6<rt>\u3057\u3085\u3046<\/rt><\/ruby>.

[\u0268] is a vowel sound in between the Standard Japanese vowels \/i\/ and \/\u026f\/. These dialects are also colloquially referred to as \u30ba\u30fc\u30ba\u30fc\u5f01 based on how the unified pronunciation of these Yotsugana are perceived by speakers of other dialects. &#8220;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u4e8c\u3064\u4eee\u540d\u5f01<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Modern Japanese, younger speakers of most dialect regions have adapted their speech to reflect the norms of Standard Japanese in which [\u30b8 and \u30c2] and [\u30ba and \u30c5] constitute interchangeable pairs with neither the fricative [\u0291i] nor the affricative [d\u0291i] being particularly favored except in word-initial position in which the affricative allophone [d\u0291i] becomes obligatory.  <br><br>Historically, however, \u4eac\u90fd\u5f01 had taken a slightly different route, in which the fricative pronunciations [\u0291i] for [\u30b8 and \u30c2] and [zu] for [\u30ba and \u30c5] in all instances except before \/N\/ \u3093, in which case the affricative allophones would reappear. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u4e09\u3064\u4eee\u540d\u5f01<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u4e09\u3064\u4eee\u540d\u5f01 are not common, but in such dialects &#8211; ex. \u5927\u5206\u5f01 &#8211; whereas [\u30b8 and \u30c2] are not distinguished, [\u30ba and \u30c5] are, with \u30ba corresponding to [zu] and \u30c5 corresponding to [dzu]. <br><br>Because there is a slight tendency throughout Japan to favor the affricative allophones, some speakers&#8217; speech naturally deviate to this three-way distinction. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u56db\u3064\u4eee\u540d\u5f01<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In dialects which still distinguish Yotsugana as four separate morae, they do so typically by exemplifying older stages of their pronunciation, ranging from how they were pronounced in Old Japanese to Late Middle Japanese (reference chart from earlier).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-footnotes\"><li id=\"6ca6a334-a865-4b4d-9428-e0efcd1269e0\">Plosive\/stop consonants are enunciated by fully stopping the airflow through the oral cavity.  <a href=\"#6ca6a334-a865-4b4d-9428-e0efcd1269e0-link\" aria-label=\"\u811a\u6ce8\u53c2\u71671\u306b\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\">\u21a9\ufe0e<\/a><\/li><li id=\"29081163-4a28-441d-bed0-8544232e782e\">Palatalization occurs when the tongue is drawn up farther toward the roof of the mouth.  <a href=\"#29081163-4a28-441d-bed0-8544232e782e-link\" aria-label=\"\u811a\u6ce8\u53c2\u71672\u306b\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\">\u21a9\ufe0e<\/a><\/li><li id=\"752ab51f-f912-4680-a757-1e907c55e751\">It was not until Early Modern Japanese that \/s\/ and \/z\/ reappeared with \/e\/.
