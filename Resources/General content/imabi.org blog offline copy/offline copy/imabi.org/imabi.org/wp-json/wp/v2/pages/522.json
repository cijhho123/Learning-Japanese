Although this appears to be Ateji, its etymology begs to differ. It&nbsp;derives from a folklore (\u6545\u4e8b) known as the \u6731\u96f2\u4f1d in which&nbsp;\u6731\u96f2 would debate with&nbsp;\u5145\u5b97 who lived in a place called&nbsp;\u4e94\u9e7f over divinations and that he was known by people at the time to break the horns of deer, befitting of the placename. Breaking the horns of a deer with brute strength would not be an easy task, and so this is then translated into Japanese as \u9aa8\u3092\u6298\u308b\u3053\u3068 as the closest idiom. In Modern Japanese, it is no longer typically used as a synonym of &#8220;hardship\/difficulty&#8221; in a purely&nbsp;nominal sense, but it most certainly lives on with this nuancing adverbially.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Patterns Utilizing \u305b\u3063\u304b\u304f<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the meaning of \u305b\u3063\u304b\u304f is fairly easy to grasp, it is usually studied in conjunction with several grammar points that it is usually paired with.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Terminology Note: To provide for a higher quality discussion from a linguistic perspective, two important Japanese grammatical terms will be referenced.&nbsp;<br><br>\u30fb\u9806\u63a5: Grammar that utilizes a conjugative particle to show cause\/effect in an affirmative context.
