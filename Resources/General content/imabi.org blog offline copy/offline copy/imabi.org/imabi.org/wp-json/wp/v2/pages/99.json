Sam will go to the park.<br>ii. Will Sam go to the park?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, the words &#8220;Sam&#8221; and &#8220;will&#8221; flip when&nbsp;i.&nbsp;is turned into a question like in ii.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Japanese no word order change is necessary to form a question, but the question is marked in some fashion as such. Typically, this is done by adding what is known as a final particle that marks the sentence as a question.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most basic way to go about this is by using the particle&nbsp;\u304b. This lesson will delve into the most important ways this particle is used in basic grammar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Basic Question \u3000<br>\u7591\u554f\u6587\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u7684\u306a\u69cb\u9020<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The formula for a&nbsp;<em>basic<\/em>&nbsp;question in Japanese will be defined as a polite sentence with no deviation in tone from a simple, harmless question. Add anything to the mix and the resulting grammar may not be the same.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In creating the basic question in Japanese, we will learn about how the particle&nbsp;\u304b is used.

Putting all that aside, the basic means of expressing these questions in Japanese are as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>\u3060\u308c\u3067\u3059\u304b \u30fc Who is it?&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u306a\u3093\u3067\u3059\u304b \u30fc What is it?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u3044\u3064\u3067\u3059\u304b \u30fc When is it?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u3069\u3053\u3067\u3059\u304b \u30fc Where is it?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u3069\u3046\u3057\u3066\u3067\u3059\u304b \u30fc Why is it?\u203b<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u3069\u3046\u3067\u3059\u304b \u30fc How is it?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In English, these question words can be used more than just to literally create a question. For instance, they may denote a subordinate clause like in &#8220;I forgot&nbsp;<strong>what<\/strong>&nbsp;I did yesterday.&#8221; They may also deviate further such as in &#8220;when I go to school&#8221; or &#8220;use this when you need help.&#8217; &nbsp;These unique circumstances call for particular grammar to be used in Japanese, some of which involves more than the basics we are going over now. You must first understand what exactly the Japanese words refer to in order to build upon them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>\u8ab0 \u30fc &#8220;Who&#8221; as in an unknown someone. &nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u4f55 \u30fc &#8220;What&#8221; as in an unknown something.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u3044\u3064 \u30fc &#8220;When&#8221; as in an unknown time.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u3069\u3053 \u30fc &#8220;Where&#8221; as in an unknown location.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u3069\u3046\u3057\u3066<sup data-fn=\"833b5974-0eac-437a-ab2d-f0be45e81689\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#833b5974-0eac-437a-ab2d-f0be45e81689\" id=\"833b5974-0eac-437a-ab2d-f0be45e81689-link\">1<\/a><\/sup> \u30fc &#8220;Why&#8221; as in an unknown reason.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u3069\u3046 \u30fc &#8220;How&#8221; as in an unknown situation\/means.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Form Note<\/strong>: In isolation, \u4f55&nbsp;is&nbsp;reading as <em>\u306a\u306b,&nbsp;<\/em>but when it is followed by \u3067\u3059, it is read as&nbsp;<em>\u306a\u3093.&nbsp;<\/em><br><br>Languages do not always exactly match in how question words are used figuratively. For instance, if you were to ask someone what part of your partner&#8217;s body do you find attractive, \u306a\u306b would not be used. Instead, \u3069\u3053 would be used because you are talking about a location on the body. Other instances of &#8220;what&#8221; overreach include the following two examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>17. \u4f4f\u6240\u306f\u3069\u3053\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>What is your address?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>18. \u3069\u3046\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>What do you think (of it)?<br><br>Another important difference is that these words are &#8220;question words.&#8221; Meaning, the word&nbsp;\u3044\u3064 cannot be used to mean &#8220;when&#8221; as in &#8220;when I go to school.&#8221; In English, &#8220;when&#8221; happens to be used both as a regular time phrase and as a question word, but this is not the case in Japanese.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u300cX\uff0b\u306f\uff0bY\uff08Question Word\uff09\uff0b\u304c\uff0b Z\u300d<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When question words are not used as the predicate of the sentence, the differences between\u00a0\u306f and\u00a0\u304c become most apparent. Instead of seeing the question word at the end of the sentence preceded by\u00a0\u306f, you see that the question word is now marked by\u00a0\u304c and that the question word is pinpointing information about the topic. Thus, it is no longer a general question.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>iii. What is a pet? \u2192 Question word at the end<br>iv. What would be good for a pet? \u2192 X\u306fY (question word)\u304cZ<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>iii. and iv. illustrate how this grammatical difference works in English. iii. follows the same line of questioning seen in the previous section whereas iv. is indicative of the sorts of questions that will soon follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the question words discussed can be used as either nouns or adverbs except&nbsp;\u3069\u3046 (how), which can only be used as an adverb.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>19. \u5ea7\u5e2d\u306f\u3069\u3053\u304c\u3044\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>What seat(s) is\/are good?<br>Literally: As for seat(s), where at is good?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>20. \u3044\u3064\uff08\u304c\uff09\u90fd\u5408\u304c\u3044\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>When will be convenient for you?<br>Literally: As for you, when is convenient?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Particle Note<\/strong>: Although&nbsp;\u3044\u3064 can be used as a noun, this is not nearly as common, so&nbsp;\u304c is always optional after it. In this example sentence,&nbsp;\u90fd\u5408\u304c\u3044\u3044 is a set phrase meaning \u201cconvenient,\u201d and because it is grammatically treated as a single adjective, two&nbsp;\u304c may be in the same clause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>21. \u65e5\u672c\u306e\u3069\u3053\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f<br>What part of Japan do you like?<br>Literally: Where of Japan do you like?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>22. \u8db3\u306e\u3069\u3053\u304c\u75db\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>What part of your leg hurts?<br>Literally: Where on your leg is it that hurts?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>23. \u304a\u571f\u7523\u306f\u4f55\u304c\u3044\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>What would be good for souvenirs?<br>Literally: As for souvenirs, what is good?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>24.\u304a\u98f2\u307f\u7269\u306f\u4f55\u304c\u3044\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>What would you like to drink?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, the very fundamental pattern &#8220;X +&nbsp;\u306f + Y +&nbsp;\u304c + Z&#8221; affects question words the same way as any other words, but this also means you\u2019ll have to pay some attention to nuance. Consider the difference between the two following sentences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>25. \u793e\u9577\u306f\u8ab0\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>Who is the company president?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The topic of conversation here is clearly the company president. The question is \u201cwho is he\/she\u201d?

The reason for this brings us to the sociolinguistic aspects. &nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Marking questions in plain speech with \u304b&nbsp;is done so largely by male speakers.

The reason for this is because adding \u304b directly to a question word usually creates phrases involving &#8220;some&#8230;&#8221;\u00a0To get around this, a speaker has two options.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Attach nothing to the question word and use a rising intonation to indicate that it is a question.<br>2. Follow the question word with the copula verb&nbsp;\u3060.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Option 2 is preferred by men, especially in casual conversation. It must be noted, though, that the tone created is meant to be stern, and an angry tone can easily make the question sound rude and demanding.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For both options, speakers often add the particle&nbsp;\u3088 to make the tone of the question more emphatic. As it is not what marks the sentence as a question, you can simply visualize it as a tack-on to the sentence. In the case of Option 1, the construction becomes feminized by the addition of&nbsp;\u3088 as the sentence looks as if the more masculine&nbsp;\u3060 is omitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>41. \u4f55\u3060\u3001\u3053\u308c\uff1f<br>What the heck is this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sentence Note<\/strong>: This sentence is inverted, but reversing the predicate and subject&nbsp;like this is common in casual speech, especially with simple questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>42. \u3048\u3063\u3001\u4f55\u3088\uff01(Feminine)<br>Wh-what the heck?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>43. \u9375\u306f\u3069\u3053\u3060\u3002<br>Where [is\/are] the key(s)?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>44. \u9375\u306f\u3069\u3053\u3060\u3088\uff01<br>Where [is\/are]&nbsp;the dang key(s)!?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>45. \u541b\u3001\u3069\u3046\u3057\u3066\u3060\u3088\uff01&nbsp;<br>You&#8230;why!?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are highly specific scenarios in which you may find a question word as the predicate followed by \u304b, but as the following example illustrates, they are always very philosophical and rhetorical and not intended to necessarily be answered directly by the listener.<br><br>46. \u4eba\u751f\u3068\u306f\u4f55\u304b\u3002<br>What exactly is life as a human?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-16018d1d wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-align-center wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/imabi.org\/the-verbs-suru-%e3%81%99%e3%82%8b-kuru-%e6%9d%a5%e3%82%8b\/\">Previous Lesson<\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-align-center wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/imabi.org\/the-particle-ka-%e3%81%8b-ii-%ef%bd%9e%e3%81%aa%e3%81%84%e3%81%8b\/\">Next Lesson<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-footnotes\"><li id=\"833b5974-0eac-437a-ab2d-f0be45e81689\">Another common word for &#8220;why?&#8221; is \u306a\u305c.
