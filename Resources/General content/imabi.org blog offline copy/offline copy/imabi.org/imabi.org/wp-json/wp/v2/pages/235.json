In Ex. 24, V<sub>1<\/sub> marked by \uff5e\u3046\u3061\u306b necessitates the consequence stated in V<sub>2<\/sub>, and we know from the use of \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u305f in V<sub>2<\/sub> that this is a recurring scenario. Meaning, V<sub>1<\/sub> is very much a snapshot of time, but that is just enough time to get red in the face from a shot. The logical association between the act and the consequence allows for the use of the non-past tense, and the intermittent nature of V<sub>1<\/sub> helps constitute a timeline similar to what we see formed with instantaneous verbs.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>24. \u9152\u3092\u3054\u304f\u3054\u304f\u3068\u98f2\u3080\uff5b\u3046\u3061\u306b  \u3007\u30fb\u9593\u306b X\uff5d\u3001\u307e\u305f\u9854\u304c<ruby>\u771f\u3063\u8d64<\/ruby>\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002<br>My face had gotten completely red again as I was gulping down the alcohol.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s posit that V<sub>2<\/sub> realizes but there is a chance that V<sub>1<\/sub> continues or may come to a halt, the non-past may be seen with \uff5e\u3046\u3061\u306b, and interchangeability between it and \uff5e\u9593\u306b is heightened.
