Broadly speaking, &#8220;accent&#8221; (\u8a1b\u308a) is the way one&#8217;s speech sounds in relation to other speakers in one&#8217;s&nbsp;region &#8211; example being&nbsp;having a British accent when speaking English. More technically speaking,&nbsp;&#8220;accent&#8221; (\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8)&nbsp;is the&nbsp;combination of phonetic properties imposed over the individual sounds that make up words.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take for instance the word &#8220;debris.&#8221; In American English, the &#8220;accented&#8221; syllable is on the second syllable, whereas in British English, the accented syllable is on the first syllable. From this one word, a lot can be gleaned about how accent systems work across languages.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>i. Accented parts of a word stand out.<br>ii. Accumulated differences regarding accent placement&nbsp;result in regional accents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>iii. Native speakers are generally aware of how other&nbsp;dialects phonotactically contrast at a subconscious level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>English has a &#8220;stress\/dynamic&#8221; accent system (\u5f37\u5f31\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8) in which syllables differ in how much stress is put on them. Thus, &#8220;stress&#8221; is the relative emphasis on certain syllables, which is&nbsp;accompanied with increased loudness as well as&nbsp;vowel lengthening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If, however, accented syllables only differ by pitch alone, the language is said to have a pitch accent (\u9ad8\u4f4e\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8), which is what characterizes Standard Japanese along with the majority of Japanese dialects.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Terminology Note<\/strong>: \u8a1b\u308a and \u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8 both translate to &#8220;accent,&#8221; but they refer to two different understandings of the word &#8220;accent.&#8221; \u8a1b\u308a refers to the overall way a person&#8217;s speech sounds, which is tied strongly to their background. On the other hand, \u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8 directly relates to &#8220;pitch accent,&#8221; which determines which morae are spoken with a higher pitch.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Notation Notes<\/strong>: Knowledge of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is required.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>i. Accented morae are in bold.<br>ii. \u2193 indicates a drop in pitch after an accented mora.<br>iii. \u21d2 indicates a shift in accent that has become fully mainstream.<br>iv. \u2192 indicates a currently observed shift in accent.<br>v. \uff1e,\uff1c, and \u2252 may be used to indicate variation in accent shift but to what frequency one version is more accepted than the other(s).\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Japanese Pitch Accent<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Japanese pitch accent is given little attention in textbooks, but&nbsp;it is not out of sheer negligence that resources, including IMABI, do not typically provide accent notation for sentences much less individual words. Reasons for this&nbsp;omission include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Of the 120 million or so native Japanese speakers, those who natively use the normative pitch accent of Standard Japanese, based on the Yamanote Dialect of Tokyo proper, are confined to&nbsp;the greater Tokyo area, and although much of the country still uses the Tokyo-type pitch accent system (~60%), individual words may&nbsp;differ greatly in their assigned accent or lack thereof. Meaning, the system itself defines the patterns which phrases may take, but which pattern is lexically assigned to a given word may vary regionally.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. How native speakers perceive standard pitch accent is an oversimplification of what is linguistically true, and posited linguistic theories that seek to accurately describe it also vary in complexity. Typically, as is implied by the name of the system in Japanese &#8211; \u9ad8\u4f4e\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;every mora is assigned a high (\u9ad8) or low (\u4f4e) pitch\/tone, but acoustically speaking, not all low and high pitches are respectively equal in sound quality.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. As is evident by the leading accent dictionaries published for native speakers such as the NHK\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u767a\u97f3\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u8f9e\u5178, with every edition, numerous edits are made. This is not to say that earlier editions are inherently faulty, but intense research has been shaping how pitch accent ought to be perceived and how it is changing in real time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Most importantly, even among Tokyoites, just as some words die out and new words are formed to represent the living world around us, the accent patterns of words themselves are also subject to change over time. A native Tokyoite in his 20s will not accent words the same as&nbsp;a native Tokyoite in his 20s will 100 years from now. The Tokyo Dialect (\u6771\u4eac\u5f01\u30fb\u6771\u4eac\u65b9\u8a00), which is the basis of Standard Japanese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.&nbsp;The Tokyo Dialect, historically, is at the southern end of the Eastern Japanese branch of the language&#8217;s dialect continuum. Most dialects of this branch&nbsp;have what is called a \u7121\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8 (no accent) system&nbsp;in which essentially all phrases are not accented. Such a simplification of the standard pitch accent is very much underway and will be become ever more prevalent as the 21st century progresses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. Perhaps the crux as to why even Japanese script doesn&#8217;t even&nbsp;distinguish&nbsp;pitch is that a non-native speaker can be understood despite incorrect intonation provided the sentence is grammatically sound. In this light, Japanese is not viewed as a tonal language despite individual syllables (morae\u203b) possessing either a low or high tone. This statement holds true despite minimal pairs existing between words which only differ in pitch accent because those pairs only exist in the confines of Standard Japanese and do not take into account intelligible dialectal pronunciations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. If pitch accent were so detrimental, Japanese dialects would not be as intelligible among each other as they currently are, nor would foreign speakers be so easily understood as mistakes would be inevitable.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To combat all these factors in our formal discussion of pitch, a few ground rules will need to be laid out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Pitch contours are referenced from the&nbsp;NHK\u767a\u97f3\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u65b0\u8f9e\u5178 (2016) and the \u65b0\u660e\u89e3\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u8f9e\u5178 (2014).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Variant pitch contours are listed by most to least preferred. Those in () are allowed in broadcasting but are still avoided in careful speech.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;L (low) tones and H (high)&nbsp;tones are understood as being relative pitch assignments to the surrounding morae. An&nbsp;<strong>H<\/strong>&nbsp;in bold indicates an accented mora.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. &#8220;Pitch&#8221; as in the tone of a given mora will be used interchangeably with &#8220;tone,&#8221; and &#8220;low tone\/pitch&#8221; and &#8220;high tone\/pitch&#8221; are notated as L (tone) and H (tone) respectively.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Terminology Note<\/strong>: The basic unit of Japanese phonology is the &#8220;mora&#8221; (\u62cd\u30fb\u30e2\u30fc\u30e9) rather than the syllable (\u97f3\u7bc0). A mora is a unit of speech perceived to be equal in length to one another. An independent&nbsp;mora&nbsp;(\u81ea\u7acb\u62cd) may be composed of a vowel (V) or consonant + vowel (CV), whereas a special mora (\u7279\u6b8a\u62cd) relies on surrounding morae to be produced but still count as an individual mora (ex. \u3063\u30fb\u3093).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Pitch Helps Distinguish Words But Doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A frequently mentioned reason for why proper pitch is important to speech is that it helps distinguish otherwise homophonous phrases. This statement is true in the sense that there are countless minimal pairs made by differences in pitch accent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, both \u751f\u547d&nbsp;(life) and&nbsp;\u58f0\u660e (proclamation) are pronounced as \u305b\u3044\u3081\u3044, but the former&#8217;s pitch is HLLL and the latter&#8217;s pitch is LHHL. As an extreme example, the following sentence is often presented:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u5ead\u306b\u306f2\u7fbd\u9d8f\u304c\u3044\u308b\u3002<br>\u30cb\u30ef\u30cb\u30cf\u30fb\u30cb\u30ef\u30fb\u30cb\u30ef\u30c8\u30ea\u30ac\u30fb\u30a4\u30eb\u3002<br>LH<strong>H<\/strong>L\u30fbHL\u30fbLHHH<strong>H<\/strong>\u30fbL*H<br>There are two chickens in the courtyard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Note<\/strong>: In faster, natural speech, \u5c45\u308b would be pronounced as HH due to the low-pitched mora being sandwiched between two high-pitched morae.&nbsp;Such &#8220;pitch flattening&#8221; in between segments is a common feature of&nbsp;natural speech. Even within relatively small phrases (whether they be isolated or juxtaposed with other phrases), changes in pitch over the course of a phrase are best understood to be gradual.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More so than individual words (\u8a9e) themselves, pitch pattern assignment is best understood by segmenting sentences into \u53e5 (phrases).&nbsp;There are four different pitch accent contours that exist in Standard Japanese:&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>&nbsp;\u982d\u9ad8\u578b&nbsp;<em>Atamadaka-gata<\/em>&nbsp;(Initial High Tone&nbsp;Accent Pattern):<br>Phrase whose accent is on the first mora, meaning the first mora is high and&nbsp;(the) subsequent mora(e)&nbsp;is\/are low&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;<strong>H<\/strong>L.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&nbsp;\u4e2d\u9ad8\u578b&nbsp;<em>Nakadaka-gata<\/em>&nbsp;(Middle High Tone&nbsp;Accent&nbsp;Pattern):<br>Phrase&nbsp;which starts off low, then the pitch is high until the accented mora, at which point the pitch falls for the remainder&nbsp;&#8211; L<strong>H<\/strong>L.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&nbsp;\u5c3e\u9ad8\u578b&nbsp;<em>Odaka-gata<\/em>&nbsp;(Final High Tone Accent Pattern):<br>Phrase which starts off low but the pitch is high until the final accented mora, then there will be a drop in pitch on any affix, usually a particle, that follows&nbsp;&#8211; L<strong>H<\/strong>(L)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&nbsp;\u5e73\u677f\u578b&nbsp;<em>Heiban-gata<\/em>&nbsp;(Flat Accent Pattern):<br>An accent-less phrase whose pitch is maintained high even when&nbsp;affixes, usually in the form of particles, follow &#8211; LH(H).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the &#8216;standard&#8217; implementation of pitch accent is key to sounding native, there are two scenarios which disprove the necessity of its accurate implementation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. The Inability to Distinguish Non-Accent Words from Final-Mora-Accented Words<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider the nouns \u7bb8 (chopsticks), \u6a4b (bridge), and \u7aef (edge). \u7bb8 is&nbsp;<strong>H<\/strong>L (\u982d\u9ad8\u578b), but \u6a4b and \u7aef differ by whether the final mora is the accented mora or not. In the case of \u6a4b, the second mora is accented, whereas for \u7aef it is not.&nbsp;Thus, \u7aef\u304c is LHH, whereas \u6a4b\u304c is L<strong>H<\/strong>L.&nbsp;Although the H tone of \u6a4b&nbsp;and&nbsp;other \u5c3e\u9ad8\u578b words is&nbsp;higher than the&nbsp;H tone of an unaccented mora&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;\u5e73\u677f\u578b word,&nbsp;native speakers normally cannot discern the difference when there is no affix present to contrast the two.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though there is an audible difference between&nbsp;\u6a4b\u304c (L<strong>H<\/strong>L) and \u7aef\u304c (LHH), it is not as stark as the difference between a word pair that differs by&nbsp;<strong>H<\/strong>L vs LH&nbsp;(ex. \u671d (morning) vs \u9ebb (hemp)). Nonetheless, even in isolation, speakers may pronounce&nbsp;the H tone of an&nbsp;\u5c3e\u9ad8\u578b word higher than&nbsp;the H tone of a \u5e73\u677f\u578b word, but this is not a perceptible difference to native speakers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, native speakers do not confuse homophones because speakers are hard wired to pay attention to context clues as opposed to pitch alterations. This does not negate how speakers pronounce these pitch patterns differently, but it is a difference that cannot be heard easily in isolation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. The Variability in Accent Across Dialects<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the last mention of other dialects&#8217; pitch accents, basic lexical items in Japanese differing in pitch&nbsp;across dialects certainly doesn&#8217;t help build the case of pitch being quintessential to comprehension.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td><strong>&nbsp;Gloss<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>\u6a19\u6e96\u8a9e<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;\u95a2\u897f\u5f01<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Rain<\/td><td>\u96e8<br><strong>H<\/strong>L<\/td><td>\u96e8<br>L<strong>H<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Oar<\/td><td>\u6ac2<br><strong>H<\/strong>L<\/td><td>\u6ac2<br>L<strong>H<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Key<\/td><td>\u9375<br>L<strong>H<\/strong>(L)<\/td><td>\u9375<strong>H<\/strong>L<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Valley<\/td><td>\u8c37<br>L<strong>H<\/strong>\uff08L)<\/td><td>\u00a0\u8c37<br>H<strong>H<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Really<\/td><td>\u30de\u30b8<br><strong>H<\/strong>L<\/td><td>\u00a0\u30de\u30b8<br>L<strong>H<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Four Pitch Contour Patterns in Detail<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Determining the pitch accent of a given phrase is an arduous task which requires both knowledge of what the possible contours are and what the likelihood is for a given contour to be assigned.&nbsp;To tackle this multifaceted dilemma, let&#8217;s closely familiarize ourselves with what the four accent patterns are.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25a0Accent or Flat? \u8d77\u4f0f\u5f0f vs \u5e73\u677f\u5f0f<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The four accent patterns &#8211; \u982d\u9ad8\u578b\u30fb\u4e2d\u9ad8\u578b\u30fb\u5c3e\u9ad8\u578b\u30fb\u5e73\u677f\u578b &#8211; can be organized according to whether there is undulation (ups-and-downs) in pitch (\u8d77\u4f0f\u5f0f)&nbsp;or if the pitch rises and stays flat (\u5e73\u677f\u5f0f). Along with these two larger groups, the following terms greatly enhance understanding of how pitch functions in general.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>&nbsp;Initial Lowering: Of the \u8d77\u4f0f\u5f0f accent patterns, non-\u982d\u9ad8\u578b words feature what is known as initial lowering in which the first mora is assigned a L tone.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&nbsp;Downstep: Immediately after an accented mora, the pitch suddenly drops.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&nbsp;Downdrift: Throughout any utterance, the overall pitch register tapers off as the speaker gets closer to the next breath. &nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&nbsp;Accent Nucleus: An alternative name for &#8220;accented mora,&#8221; which can aid the learner to pinpoint where said accent lies in phrases regardless of length.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&nbsp;Pitch Leveling: The reduction\/simplification of undulations in pitch observed when combining segments of a phrase and\/or sentence together.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25a1The Accent Nucleus<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The accented mora can also be called&nbsp;the &#8220;accent nucleus&#8221; (\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u6838).

These scenarios can all be viewed as systematic pitch leveling built into the phraseology\u00a0of the language.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>Pitches of Individual<br>Morphemes<\/strong><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>Pitches of Combined<br>Morphemes<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u85c1 (straw)\/<strong>wa<\/strong>\u2193\u027ea\/ (HL)<br><br>\u9ea6 (wheat)\/<strong>m\u026f<\/strong>\u2193gi\/ (HL)<br><br>\u3053\u306e (this)\/kono\/ (LH)<br><br>\u5e3d\u5b50 (hat)\/bo:\u0255i\/ (LHH)<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u3053\u306e\u85c1 (this hat) <br>\/kono-<strong>wa\u2193<\/strong>\u027ea\/ (LHHL)<br>\u9ea6\u85c1 (wheat straw)\u00a0<br>\/m\u026fgiwa\u027ea\/ or \/m\u026fgi<strong>wa\u2193<\/strong>\u027ea\/<br>\u3053\u306e\u9ea6\u85c1 (this wheat straw) <br>\/kono-m\u026fgiwa\u027ea\/ (LHHHHH)<br>\u3053\u306e\u9ea6\u85c1\u5e3d\u5b50\u304c (this wheat straw hat\u00a0<em>subj<\/em>.)<br>\/\u00a0kono-m\u026fgiwa\u027ea-<strong>bo\u2193<\/strong>:\u0255i-ga\/ (LHHHHHHLLL)<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u203b\u2193 indicates a downstep.&nbsp;Its absence after lexically&nbsp;H-toned morae indicates that a phrase is \u5e73\u677f\u5f0f, whereas its presence indicates a&nbsp;\u8d77\u4f0f\u5f0f&nbsp;contour. Only accented high-tone morae are in bold. This convention is extended throughout this lesson.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25a1Pitch Leveling Affecting Initial Lowering<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At times,&nbsp;as we saw earlier with \u5c45\u308b, pitch leveling occurs when the undulation of a phrase is difficult to maintain in fast, natural speech. This can affect how initial lowering manifests. Generally speaking, phrases with a lexically assigned initial lowering are enunciated this way when sentence-initial, but there are a few conditions which may trigger a pitch leveling that renders this L tone as high as a non-accented H tone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly to how an L-toned mora&nbsp;sandwiched between two H-toned morae may become high tone by association, when the second mora of a non-\u982d\u9ad8\u578b word is either a \u3093&nbsp;or the lengthening half of a long vowel (\u30fc), the tone of the first mora is as high as the H tone of a non-accented mora.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Word<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Natural Pitch Contour<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Lexical Pitch Contour<br>(Slow\/Deliberate\u00a0Speech)<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\u53cd\u5fdc (reaction)<br>\/haNno:\/<\/td><td>HHHH(H)<\/td><td>LHHH(H)<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In deliberately slow speech, such lexically assigned instances of initial lowering&nbsp; will be clearly enunciated as L tone. Due to this and the fact that it would not be as high as an accented mora, such environmentally not so low L morae are still marked as L in leading pitch dictionaries as entries are meant to be interpreted as single-standing words in isolation in careful speech.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another phenomenon not overtly noted in pitch dictionaries is how initial lowering is prolonged whenever the second mora is a \u3063.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td><strong>&nbsp;Word<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Natural Pitch Contour<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;Lexical Pitch Contour<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\u5207\u8179 (seppuku)\/seQp\u026fk\u026f\/<\/td><td>LLHH(H)<\/td><td>LHHH(H)<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is likely due to it being a quasi-mora that&nbsp;although being perceived as equal in length to any other mora is not. However, a second mora being slightly lower than normal is not a hindrance to lexically assigned it a H tone, especially since \u3063 happens to be banned from being an accent nucleus in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25a1The \u5e73\u677f\u5f0f Grouping<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The \u5e73\u677f\u578b is the only accent pattern in the \u5e73\u677f\u5f0f grouping. This pattern accounts for approximately half of all Japanese words, and this percentage is growing by the decade.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is meant by &#8220;flat&#8221; is that the phrase is accentless with the first mora being low and subsequent mora(e) being H tone, meaning there is no downstep.&nbsp;However, the pitch of such a chain of H tone morae in a &#8220;flat&#8221; phrase are, in fact, not equally high as one another. This is because of the&nbsp;&#8220;downdrift&#8221; phenomenon,&nbsp;but imagine this being akin to rolling down a smooth decline rather than falling off a cliff.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u25a0Binary vs Tertiary Pitch<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier&nbsp;we learned how the accented&nbsp;<strong>H<\/strong>-toned mora&nbsp;in \u5c3e\u9ad8\u578b words&nbsp;is technically higher than&nbsp;the non-accented H-toned mora(e)&nbsp;in \u5e73\u677f\u578b words when no affix is present. To account for this, it is possible to propose a M (mid) tone and assign it to the less-high H tone in \u5e73\u677f\u578b words.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Word<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;Tertiary System<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;Binary System<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\u82b1 (flower)<br>\/hana\/<\/td><td>L<strong>H<\/strong><\/td><td>L<strong>H<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u9f3b (nose)<br>\/hana\/<\/td><td>LM<\/td><td>LH<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, the tertiary system hypothesis was abandoned due to subsequent research which indicated that native speakers don&#8217;t perceive the distinction even if it is there when certain words are juxtaposed in isolation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oddly enough, the M tone was also used to correspond to any L mora(e) in a \u8d77\u4f0f\u5f0f word that immediately follows&nbsp;a downstep, assuming that the phrase is short enough for the subsequent morae to not ultimately be lower than an initial lowering if present due downdrift as well as any subsequent downsteps.

Of the words listed in this chart alone, two have notably different accent patterns in modern speech than their historically correct assignments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ex. \u82b1\u5a7f LH<strong>H<\/strong>L \u21d2&nbsp;<strong>LH<\/strong>LL<br>Ex. \u6771\u6d77\u9053 HLLLLL \u21d2 LH<strong>H<\/strong>LLL<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Terminology Note<\/strong>: To distinguish the different possible \u4e2d\u9ad8\u578b, numbers in circles will indicate the&nbsp;mora placement of the accent nucleus. So, \u4e2d\u9ad8\u578b\u2463 would indicate said&nbsp;pattern in which the accent nucleus is on the fourth mora.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Distribution of Pitch Patterns in Nouns by Mora Count<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many observations can be made about the distribution of the four pitch patterns in nouns by mora count. Most importantly, the ongoing simplification of Standard Japanese pitch, which can be described as the reduction of mid-word undulation of pitch, can be best studied by narrowing one&#8217;s view on mora count to see how pitch is changing based on word length. In general, the percentages of&nbsp;\u982d\u9ad8\u578b and&nbsp;\u5e73\u677f\u578b are particularly on the rise as their contours are less complex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that is certain about nouns is that within any given mora count, that the possible contours for said count will always be one greater. This is to account for\u00a0the \u4e2d\u9ad8\u578b pattern accounting for any accented mora not on the first or last mora. Therefore,\u00a0three-mora words display four possible contours: HLL, LHL, LHH(L), or LHH(H). Likewise, four-mora words display five possible contours: HLL, LHHL, LHLL, LHHH(L), or LHHH(H).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td>Morae<\/td><td><strong>Pattern<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Tendencies<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>\u5e73\u677f\u578b<br>L(H)<\/td><td>Approximately 30% of one-mora nouns are unaccented; the more common it is, the more likely it is unaccented.\u868a \/ka\/ (mosquito)<br><br>\u86fe \/ga\/ (moth)<br>\u6c17 \/ki\/ (qi)<br>\u8840 \/t\u0255i\/ (blood)<br>\u8449 \/ha\/ (leaf)<br>\u5dee \/sa\/ (difference)<br>\u56f3 \/dz\u026f\/ (illustration)<br>\u85fb \/mo\/ (algae)<br>\u8eab\u00a0 \/mi\/ (body)<br>\u5b9f \/mi\/ (fruit\/nut)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>\u982d\u9ad8\u578b<strong>H<\/strong>(L)<\/td><td>Approximately 70% of one-mora nouns are accented.
