Without proper grace and etiquette as well as sensitivity to the matter at hand, apologies can be interpreted as insincere. As such, more so than even the words that go into an apology, the way one conducts oneself is what&#8217;s most important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the phrases introduced in this lesson, internal complexity&nbsp;due to speech styles and so on will inevitably cause grammar we have not covered. For the&nbsp;purpose of this lesson, though, focus on the phrases that center around apologizing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic translation of \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d in Japanese is&nbsp;\u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093. This comes from the verb \u6e08\u3080, which has the literal meaning of &#8220;to finish&#8221; but also has the nuance of &#8220;to feel guilty (about something not ending satisfactorily).&#8221; In somewhat informal\/dialectal speech, you may also hear&nbsp;\u3059\u3044\u307e\u305b\u3093 or \u3059\u3093\u307e\u305b\u3093. In (casual) plain speech, you may hear it as \u3059\u307e\u306a\u3044 or even<em>&nbsp;<\/em>\u3059\u307e\u3093.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These non-past forms may also be used to mean &#8220;excuse me&#8221; in the sense of getting someone&#8217;s attention, often to have the person get out of the way or simply having them notice something important. This phrase may&nbsp;even be used in the sense of &#8220;thank you&#8221; for when you have someone help you with something.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the intonation (see below) of the phrase doesn&#8217;t change between these three nuances, the tone and speed of one&#8217;s voice will. In the apologetic sense, especially when&nbsp;apologizing for a situation that had occurred in the past that you feel strongly responsible for, it is possible to see it conjugated into the past tense.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Casual Plain Non-Past<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>&nbsp;Plain Non-Past<\/strong><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>&nbsp;Polite Non-Past<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u3059\u307e\u3093<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">&nbsp;\u3059\u307e\u306a\u3044<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">&nbsp;\u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">&nbsp;<strong>Casual Plain Past<\/strong><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">&nbsp;<strong>Plain Past<\/strong><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">&nbsp;<strong>Polite Past<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">&nbsp;\u3059\u307e\u3093\u304b\u3063\u305f<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">&nbsp;\u3059\u307e\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">&nbsp;\u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Intonation Notes:<br><\/strong>1. \u3059<strong>\u307e<\/strong>\u306a\u3044.<br>2. \u3059<strong>\u307f\u307e\u305b<\/strong>\u3093.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Orthography Note<\/strong>: Writing the verb stem in Kanji as \u6e08 is rare when the verb is used in apologies, and doing so is not recommended.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u5148\u65e5\u306f\u4f1a\u8b70\u306b\u9045\u308c\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u3066\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I&#8217;m really sorry for being late to the meeting the other day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u307e\u3058\u3059\u307e\u3093\u304b\u3063\u305f\uff01(Extremely Casual)<br>I&#8217;m really sorry about that!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3001\u901a\u3057\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002<br>Excuse me, could you let me through?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u9593\u9055\u3048\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u3066\u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002<br>I\u2019m sorry for messing up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. \u6df7\u4e71\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u3066\u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002<br>I\u2019m sorry for confusing you. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. \u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3001\u304a\u6642\u9593\u3088\u308d\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>Excuse me, but could I take a little bit of your time?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. \u3059\u3044\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3001\u304a\u52d8\u5b9a\u304a\u9858\u3044\u3057\u307e\u3059\uff01<br>Excuse me!

It is customary to use \u5931\u793c\u3057\u307e\u3059. You could also say \u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3001\u3053\u3093\u306a\u6642\u9593\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3089 to notify those in the room that it&#8217;s already time to leave, but when you are finally executing, you would still say \u5931\u793c\u3057\u307e\u3059 to excuse yourself.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you see \u5931\u793c\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f, its past tense form, the speaker is apologizing for having been discourteous somehow. Perhaps you called someone by the wrong name. Maybe you overreacted and responded with too long of an e-mail. These are the sort of situations when this phrase would be perfect for apologizing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Plain Non-Past<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;Polite Non-Past<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;Humble Non-Past<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\u5931\u793c\u3059\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5931\u793c\u3057\u307e\u3059<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5931\u793c\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>&nbsp;Plain Past<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;Polite Past<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;Humble Past<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u5931\u793c\u3057\u305f<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5931\u793c\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5931\u793c\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Usage Notes<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. The plain forms exist because people can still tell equals, people below them, or friends that they&#8217;ve been rude somehow. Additionally, there are grammatical circumstances, for instance, modifying a noun like \u3068\u304d (when), in which the verb cannot be in a polite conjugation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u5931\u793c\u3057\u307e\u3059 is the go-to phrase for when hanging up on someone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Intonation Note<\/strong>: The intonation of&nbsp;\u5931\u793c is \u3057<strong>\u3064<\/strong>\u308c\u3044.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9a. \u9577\u6587\u5931\u793c\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>9b. \u9577\u6587\u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093\uff08\u3067\u3057\u305f\uff09\u3002<br>I apologize for (how I wrote) this long message.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sentence Notes<\/strong>:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. 9a and 9b are very similar in nuance with 9a being more polite than 9b. The difference as to why \u3067\u3057\u305f is not necessarily obligatory with \u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093 but is with&nbsp;\u5931\u793c lies in&nbsp;a very finite difference between the two words.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Firstly, \u5931\u793c\u3059\u308b literally means &#8220;to do something that is impolite.&#8221; Remember that&nbsp;&#8220;non-past&#8221; covers what in English would be either &#8220;present tense&#8221; or the &#8220;future tense&#8221; When referring to an action in the moment, Japanese verbs will always translate as &#8220;I am going to do X.&#8221; So, \u9577\u6587\u5931\u793c\u3057\u307e\u3059, if you were to use it, would need to be at the start of the document you&#8217;re sending. This is because the long text is coming up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Vice versa, when you&#8217;ve already written it and the person had to go through the struggle of reading it all, you mark your discourteous &#8220;past&#8221; behavior with \u9577\u6587\u5931\u793c\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. As for \u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093, you are recognizing that there could have been a better way of handling the situation. Perhaps you could have condensed your message down. At any rate, you&#8217;re showing remorse for the situation not being ideal at the end of the day, but that lack of satisfaction isn&#8217;t a thing of the past to you, the writer, necessarily.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. If you were to use \u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f, you&#8217;re basically cutting off these logical loose ends by apologizing, albeit still politely, for doing something that wasn&#8217;t the most ideal way of going about it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10. \u5931\u793c\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u7533\u3057\u8a33\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002<br>Please excuse (my behavior\/action).

This phrase literally means &#8220;I have no excuse,&#8221; and it is considered more formal than a simple \u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093 and even used in conjunction with \u5931\u793c\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f as we saw in Ex. 10.
