Aspect marking is often lumped together with the concept of tense, but in the context of \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b, it is rather difficult to relate to any one structure in English to it. Though the tense of \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b would default to the &#8220;present perfect (= &#8220;has\/have been&#8221;),&#8221; the aspect of \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b would pertain to how the state borne from some action came about via the willful intent of an agent and how the resultant state remains so; yet, the English translations do not employ &#8220;-ing&#8221; (the continuous form) despite the continuous state. This, however, is where \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b\u30fb\u3066\u3044\u308b naturally form a semantic class which expresses the aspect of ongoing states, which can be viewed as an extension of their existential semantics, with their own implications on being that cannot be fully explained by how English tense\/aspect syntactically work.   <a href=\"#c457ef89-695b-4960-953d-4c6dbef84f8d-link\" aria-label=\"\u811a\u6ce8\u53c2\u71671\u306b\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\">\u21a9\ufe0e<\/a><\/li><li id=\"f7e0a79e-39f8-4fcb-b6d8-b1196f85acd0\">Merely describing X&#8217; as the subject with \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b is not entirely accurate. This pattern is just one of many grammatical patterns in Japanese which invokes what is known as ergative grammar. In ergative grammar, the objects of transitive predicates become rendered as subjects when the predicate is rendered intransitive. \u3042\u308b imposes its intransitivity onto the transitive predicates utilized in \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b, thus, causing this change in particle usage. As such, X&#8217; can be viewed as both the subject and the object depending on which angle you view the construction. As a subject, X&#8217; is what is experiencing the state, but it is also the object of the implied agent&#8217;s action which resulted in said state being described as if it were the subject.   <a href=\"#f7e0a79e-39f8-4fcb-b6d8-b1196f85acd0-link\" aria-label=\"\u811a\u6ce8\u53c2\u71672\u306b\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\">\u21a9\ufe0e<\/a><\/li><li id=\"41f91fcb-449e-4f2e-a4e3-dc267cca1be7\">&#8220;Surface structures&#8221; (\u8868\u5c64\u69cb\u9020) are the versions of sentences that are actually uttered in speech.  <a href=\"#41f91fcb-449e-4f2e-a4e3-dc267cca1be7-link\" aria-label=\"\u811a\u6ce8\u53c2\u71673\u306b\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\">\u21a9\ufe0e<\/a><\/li><li id=\"148c901a-357f-4390-a5b2-9c8007f77fc7\">When \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044 is contracted to \uff5e\u3066\u306a\u3044, the intonation of \uff5e\u306a\u3044 itself is a continuation of the pattern attributed to the verb structure as one unit, whereas when \uff5e\u3066\u306a\u3044 is the negative form of \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b, \u3042\u308b maintains its pitch nucleus on the first mora, which is naturally applied to \u306a\u3044.  <a href=\"#148c901a-357f-4390-a5b2-9c8007f77fc7-link\" aria-label=\"\u811a\u6ce8\u53c2\u71674\u306b\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\">\u21a9\ufe0e<\/a><\/li><\/ol>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b&nbsp; While we have just learned how \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u308b may be used to indicate continuous action or status in a partic<a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/imabi.org\/stative-verbs-te-aru-%ef%bd%9e%e3%81%a6%e3%81%82%e3%82%8b\/\">\u7d9a\u304d\u3092\u8aad\u3080 <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">&#8220;\uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b&#8221;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":158153075,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"footnotes":"[{\"content\":\"Aspect (\u76f8) is a crucial feature of Japanese grammar that cannot be overlooked even as a beginner. Aspect marking is often lumped together with the concept of tense, but in the context of \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b, it is rather difficult to relate to any one structure in English to it. Though the tense of \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b would default to the \\\"present perfect (= \\\"has\/have been\\\"),\\\" the aspect of \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b would pertain to how the state borne from some action came about via the willful intent of an agent and how the resultant state remains so; yet, the English translations do not employ \\\"-ing\\\" (the continuous form) despite the continuous state. This, however, is where \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b\u30fb\u3066\u3044\u308b naturally form a semantic class which expresses the aspect of ongoing states, which can be viewed as an extension of their existential semantics, with their own implications on being that cannot be fully explained by how English tense\/aspect syntactically work.  \",\"id\":\"c457ef89-695b-4960-953d-4c6dbef84f8d\"},{\"content\":\"Merely describing X' as the subject with \uff5e\u3066\u3042\u308b is not entirely accurate.
