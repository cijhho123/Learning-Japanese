This is &#8220;the thing&#8221; which is being stated as true. As for why \u3060 is optional here, this is a both a matter of style and a reflection of how \u3082\u306e is more so than not functionally a final particle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Customary Action<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Customary action may also be simply expressed with&nbsp;\uff5e\u3066\u3044\u305f, which also equates to &#8220;used to.&#8221;&nbsp;However, unlike \uff5e\u305f\u3082\u306e\u3060, there is no reminiscent undertone. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10. \u6bce\u671d\u30b8\u30e7\u30ae\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I used to jog every morning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11. \u4e2d\u5b66\u6821\u306e\u6642\u3001\u6bce\u66699\u6642\u306b\u5bdd\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002<br>I used to go to bed every night at nine when I was in junior high.<br><br>Though not shown previously, \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3082\u306e\u3060 is, in fact, grammatical. In this situation, \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u305f maintains its function of describing repetitive action and\/or action that is done over a prolonged period of time, and \uff5e\u3082\u306e\u3060 reflects over that experience in hindsight. <br><br>12. \u9ad8\u6821\u751f\u306e\u6642\u3001\u671d\u3063\u3071\u3089\u304b\u3089\u6bce\u65e5\u30b8\u30e7\u30ae\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3082\u3093\u3060\u3002<br>When I was a high school student, I used to jog every day early in the morning.<br><br>Based on the emotional status of the speaker, however, even a rather emotionally significant matter need not necessarily be accompanied with \u3082\u306e\u3060. This is because, in many ways, \uff5e\u3082\u306e\u3060 functions as a complex final particle whose purpose is borne out by the speaker&#8217;s mental reflection on the experience. If the speaker does not feel any particular reason to add weight\/significance to the statement, \uff5e\u3082\u306e\u3060 is less likely to be used.<br><br>13. \u79c1\u304c\u5c0f\u3055\u304b\u3063\u305f\u9803\u3001\u6bce\u591c\u304a\u306d\u3057\u3087\u3057\u3066\u3088\u304f\u6ce3\u3044\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u306a\u305c\u304a\u6f0f\u3089\u3057\u3059\u308b\u306e\u3068\u6bcd\u306b\u3088\u304f\u805e\u304b\u308c\u3001\u602f\u3048\u3066\u7b54\u3048\u3089\u308c\u305a\u306b\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>When I was little, I would wet the bed and cried a lot. I would be asked why I peed by my mother, but I could never answer out of fright. <br><br>The lack of \uff5e\u3082\u306e\u3060 does not pose a grammatical issue. Rather, if it had been used, the speaker would be trying to make a point based on this experience. Instead, the speaker here sounds composed. Note that the act of highlighting any particular emotion, positive or negative, by \uff5e\u3082\u306e\u3060 is done so at a personal yet objective level, often to make a point of some sort, which is not the speaker&#8217;s motive here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u304b\u3064\u3066<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually spelled in Hiragana<sup data-fn=\"60990761-1792-42c2-a2e9-aae479756182\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#60990761-1792-42c2-a2e9-aae479756182\" id=\"60990761-1792-42c2-a2e9-aae479756182-link\">2<\/a><\/sup> as \u304b\u3064\u3066, this adverb translates as &#8220;formerly\/once,&#8221; which are both less colloquial means of phrasing &#8220;used to be.&#8221; \u304b\u3064\u3066 is not as common as \u524d\u306f\u30fb\u4ee5\u524d\u306f (previously), but they are largely synonymous. <br><br>As these temporal phrases serve to point to a vague point in time in the past, they may be used with \uff5e\u3082\u306e\u3060 when the emotional conditions are met.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14. \u5f7c\u306f\u304b\u3064\u3066\u7d44\u7e54\u306e\u4e00\u54e1\u3067\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>He used to be a member of the organization. <br><br>15. \u304b\u3064\u3066\u3053\u3061\u3089\u306b\u4f4f\u3093\u3067\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br> I once used to live here.<br><br>16. \u304b\u3064\u3066\u3001\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u4e16\u754c\u5927\u6226\u3067\u3001\u30c9\u30a4\u30c4\u306f\u30a4\u30bf\u30ea\u30a2\u3068\u540c\u76df\u56fd\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002 <br>Germany was once an ally of Italy in World War II.<br><br>Occasionally, you may even see \u304b\u3064\u3066 followed by the particle \u306e as an adverbial noun.
