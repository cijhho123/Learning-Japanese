For <em>Godan <\/em>verbs whose \u672a\u7136\u5f62 already ends in \/sa\/, there is no need to add yet another \/sa\/.

The reason for this is due to the well-known perception of its ungrammaticality, and so when someone must spend time to prepare a statement utilizing proper honorific speech, &#8216;common&#8217; mistakes are mostly likely to be avoided.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Though upwards of 30% of speakers admit to using \/sa\/-insertion, only a fraction of these speakers admit to believing it&#8217;s grammatically acceptable.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hypercorrection&nbsp;of \/sa\/-insertion can be spotted when the transitive form of a verb ends in \/-asu\/ when combined with \uff5e\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304f.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Of these points, observation 9 is the most intriguing. As an example, consider the verb \u98db\u3070\u3059 (to skip over). This is the transitive form of \u98db\u3076 (to fly), but they DO NOT share the same causative forms, at least not necessarily.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard causative form of \u98db\u3076 is \u98db\u3070\u305b\u308b. When used with \uff5e\uff08\u3055\uff09\u305b\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304f, \u98db\u3070\u305b\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304f.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although \u98db\u3070\u3059 can indeed mean &#8220;to send flying,&#8221; its nuance is not the same as the causative form. Some may point out that the past tense and te-forms&nbsp;\u98db\u3070\u305b\u305f\u30fb\u98db\u3070\u305b\u3066 can respectively be seen as \u98db\u3070\u3057\u305f\u30fb\u98db\u3070\u3057\u3066, but this is a matter of accent\/dialect, not the intrinsic nature of the grammar involved. To use \uff5e\uff08\u3055\uff09\u305b\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304fwith \u98db\u3070\u3059, you&#8217;d still get \u98db\u3070\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u6642\u9593\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\u3067\u98db\u3070\u3055\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3057\u3066\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb<br>With time being a small concern, allow me to skip through&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, as this example shows, \u305b \u2192 \u3057 can still occur with any iteration of the causative speech of <em>Godan <\/em>verbs as a matter of dialect.

However, in the case of \u826f\u3044 (to be good) and \u7121\u3044 (to not be there\/to not have), \u3055 is inserted as a cushion syllable. The reason for why this arose with just these two adjectives is still uncertain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some speakers take issue with the analysis that this rule only affects these two adjectives. Instead, they feel that it affects all two-syllable adjectives. To their defense, there are only two other such adjectives in the entire language: \u6fc3\u3044 and \u6182\u3044.

When you remove the sentence endings, the results are 28K+&nbsp;and 200K+ respectively. These results suggest that speakers overwhelmingly choose \u6fc3\u305d\u3046 as the preferred form. When observing results for \u6fc3\u3055\u305d\u3046 more closely, many come about from discussions regarding its grammaticality. However, such discussions cannot be use to discredit the phrase&#8217;s existence as many posts can be found where speakers claim it&#8217;s the preferred form in conversation where they live. In standard education, \u6fc3\u305d\u3046 is, in fact, deemed the correct form of the expression, which may have an effective on how prevalent it is used in the written language, which Internet posts would be a subset of.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When researching \u6182\u3044, it must be noted that the adjective is rarely used in isolation. If used at all, it is usually paired with the prefix \u3082\u306e\uff5e to get \u7269\u6182\u3044 meaning &#8220;melancholy.&#8221; Since its use is so rare in the spoken language, one may presume that the form \u6182\u3055\u305d\u3046 might still exist if there are indeed speakers that believe inserting \u3055 onto such two-syllable adjectives is obligatory. Upon Google searching it, only three examples appear, all used with \u7269\u6182\u3044 instead. Each example is found in novel-like prose, which may be indicative of novice mistakes from a younger generation.
