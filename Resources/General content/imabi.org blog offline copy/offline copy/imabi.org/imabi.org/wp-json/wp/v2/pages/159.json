It can show the resultant action\/effect from the previous course of action much like how &#8220;then&#8221; is used in &#8220;then, this happened&#8221; or &#8220;then, I ended up doing this&#8230;&#8221; Or, it can be used to build on a previous description emphatically. The former nuance retains a temporal, logical chain of events, whereas the latter nuance loses this temporal sense to simply expand upon a description. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, learning how to use \u305d\u3057\u3066 correctly incidentally conjures up contexts in which adjectival\/verbal predicates need to be conjoined. To do this, we need a conjunctive particle to link each dependent clause to the main clause. Although we have not discussed it just yet, the solution to this is the \u3066 form (Lessons 33-35). For now, just pay attention to where \u305d\u3057\u3066 shows up in the following two examples.<br><br>12. \u65e9\u8d77\u304d\u3057\u3066\u3001\u671d\u3054\u98ef\u3092\u98df\u3079\u3066\u3001\u8a66\u9a13\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u3066\u3001\u305d\uff08\u3046\uff09\u3057\u3066\u30af\u30e9\u30d6\u306b\u305f\u3069\u308a\u7740\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I woke up early, ate breakfast, took an exam, and then&#8230; I ended up at the club.<br><br>13. \u7834\u58ca\u306f\u54c0\u308c\u3067\u60b2\u3057\u304f\u3066\u3001\u305d\uff08\u3046\uff09\u3057\u3066\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3060\u3002<br>Destruction is pitiable and sad, <em>and<\/em> it is also a beautiful thing. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Omitting Consecutive \u3068<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The omission of consecutive \u3068 is technically possible, but this is not so common with just two nouns. When two nouns are conjoined without the particle \u3068, you will often see a \u4e2d\u9ed2\uff08\u30fb\uff09 in between. In speech, however, this punctuation mark will often still be read as \u3068.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14. \u30a2\u30f3\u30b1\u30fc\u30c8\u7528\u7d19\u306b\u5e74\u9f62\u30fb\u6027\u5225\u306e\u9805\u76ee\u3092\u8a18\u5165\u3057\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002(Written Language)<br>Please fill in the age and gender fields on the questionnaire sheet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The omission of consecutive \u3068 does become more common when three or more things are being listed.&nbsp;You may see&nbsp;several things being listed with \uff0c (the \u30b3\u30f3\u30de)\u2014usually in &#8220;A\u3068B\u3001C\uff5e&#8221; format \u2014or obligatorily with \u30fb (\u4e2d\u9ed2) if all instances of \u3068 are omitted. <br><br>In the written language, the pattern&nbsp;&#8220;A\uff0cB\u3068C&#8221; is particularly&nbsp;treated as an English-style format as opposed to the more natural, native Japanese style in which \u3068 is, in fact, spoken&nbsp;in between each noun\u2014potentially after the final&nbsp;noun as well.

In the spoken language, coincidental dropping of \u3068, again, is unlikely and could be written off as a slip of the tongue, and in the event of recalling many things, a subtle hint to the speaker&#8217;s mind that subsequent things being stated may not hold as much importance than if they were to actually use \u3068 each time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u3068Cannot Go Between a Noun &amp; an Adjective or VICE VERSA<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The meaning of &#8220;and&#8221; only works when \u3068 is between two or more&nbsp;<em><strong><em>noun<\/em><\/strong><\/em><strong><em>s<\/em><\/strong>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>16a. \u79c1\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u3068\u533b\u8005\u3067\u3059 X<br>16b. \u79c1\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u4eba<strong>\u3067<\/strong>\u533b\u8005\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3007<br>I am Japanese and a doctor.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>16a is wrong because this&nbsp;is violated in a more complicated way.
