The consequence, however, is that a truth statement marked by \uff5e\u305f  in an indirect quote would have to be contained within the past, causing the quote take on a retrospective aspect, and with the retrospection taking place in the present, the citation verb itself, thus, would be stated in the non-past tense. As an example of this, consider the following. <br><br>16. \u672c\u5f53\u306b\u898b\u3066\u304f\u308c\u305f\u3089\u3001\u7d76\u5bfe\u306b\u9762\u767d\u304b\u3063\u305f\uff08\u3060\u308d\u3046\uff09\u3068\u601d\u3046\u3002<br>If they had actually watched (the movie), I&#8217;m sure it was definitely fun (for them).<br><br>The lack of tense agreement in Japanese does not forbid the possibility of \uff5e\u305f appearing both in the dependent and independent clauses of the same sentence.

When Y&#8217; stands for an adjectival-noun embedded predicate, as is the case in Ex. 32, \u3060 is typically present provided that the quote is a reflection of the copular nature of the quote itself as well as the degree to which \u3060 affirms a statement, in which case its level of &#8220;modality&#8221; as it pertains to affirmation is said to be high. <br><br>Without \u3060, modality as it pertains to affirmation is said to be low. This allows for its ellipsis so long as the predicative role of the adjectival noun involved is readily inferable &#8211; a subjective measure at best but sufficient for explaining its ellipsis in grammar structures such as \uff5e\u3068\u3044\u3063\u3066\u3082 (&#8220;although&#8230; might say&#8230;).<br><br>33. \u30d2\u30f3\u30d0\u30b9\u306a\u3093\u3066\u7dba\u9e97\uff5b\u3060 \u3007\u30fb\u2205 \u3007\uff5d\u3068\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3082\u304b\u308f\u3044\u3044\u3068\u306f\u8a00\u3044\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002<br>Even if I were to call Feebas pretty, I wouldn&#8217;t call it cute. <br><br>Now, as for nominal predicates, consider the following. <br><br>34. \u81ea\u5206\u306f\u300c\u732b\u300d\u3060\u3068\u4e3b\u5f35\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002<br>They insist that they are a &#8220;cat.&#8221; <br><br>Here, the affirmative declaration made by &#8220;they&#8221; is [(I) am a cat]. We see that, putting aside the extra focus on the word &#8220;cat&#8221; itself, the declarative=copular role of \u3060 is unquestionable. If this high modality is lowered such that &#8220;that&#8230; is&#8221; is more akin &#8220;as&#8230;,&#8221; \u3060 is not present, rendering the quotation clause more like an adverbial qualification of the citation verb. <br><br>35. \u98fc\u3044\u4e3b\u3092\u201d\u5b50\u4f9b\u201d\u3068\u601d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u732b\u304c\u3059\u308b\u4ed5\u8349\u306e\u3072\u3068\u3064\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3000<br>That&#8217;s one mannerism cats, who think of their owner as a &#8220;kid,&#8221; do. <br><br>Another reason for why \u3068 would not necessarily coexist with \u3060 in contexts in which \u3068 functions as &#8220;as&#8221; is that &#8220;as&#8221; is, in a way, copula-like in function<sup data-fn=\"4c826d8f-802f-471a-b7ad-e34cae24971c\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#4c826d8f-802f-471a-b7ad-e34cae24971c\" id=\"4c826d8f-802f-471a-b7ad-e34cae24971c-link\">2<\/a><\/sup>, though not as assertive in tone or implication as the copula \u3060 proper.

By using \uff5e\u3082\u306e\u3068\u601d\u308f\u308c\u308b, for instance, an objective, level-headed approach does not match well with an overbearing assertion. <br><br>37. \u305d\u306e\u539f\u56e0\u306f\u6c17\u5019\u5909\u52d5\u306b\u3088\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3068\u601d\u308f\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>The cause of that is believed to be climate change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many dialects and among the speaker variation found within Standard Japanese proper, \u3060 does, in fact, get frequently omitted in both environments\u2014with adjectival-noun predicates and noun-predicates\u2014with modality adjustment being the primary factor.
