However, the Kanji itself was miswritten as&nbsp;\ud855\udf71 and given the ON reading of \u30b8\u30e7. What began as a misprint ended up being the standard means of writing this unit, and this remains the case.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically speaking, the values associated with these units were unified in the mid-1600s. The system of changing units every fourth power is known as the \u4e07\u9032\u6cd5.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before this point, Sino-numerals larger than \u4e07 had varying values based on three separate systems. Initially, \u5341\u4e07 (10^5), \u767e\u4e07 (10^6), and \u5343\u4e07 (10^7) held .the same value as they do today, but a system known as \u4e0b\u6570 was devised in which the unit would change after every power of 10 past \u4e07. This resulted in \u5104 and \u5146 having the values 10^5 and 10^6 respectively.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting in the Han Dynasty, however, a system known as \u4e0a\u6570 was devised in which the next unit would begin after the square of the previous unit was met. In this system, \u4e07\u4e07 = \u5104 (10^8), \u5104\u5104 = \u5146 (10^16), and \u5146\u5146 = \u4eac (10^32).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later on, a system known as \u4e2d\u6570 was devised in which \u5343\u4e07 (10^7) was followed by \u5104, and this matched with the current Japanese system up until \u5343\u5104 (10^11), but the next unit would be every&nbsp;8 powers. This is known as \u4e07\u4e07\u9032. \u5343\u5104 (10^11), thus, would be followed by \u4e07\u5104&nbsp; (10^12), \u5341\u4e07\u5104 (10^13), \u767e\u4e07\u5104 (10^14), and \u5343\u4e07\u5104&nbsp;(10^15). This meant that \u5146 stood for 10^16.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, around when larger units were being devised, the \u4e07\u9032\u6cd5 system utilized by Japan began to appear, and this is of course what Japan ultimately decided to standardize its Sino-Japanese numerals with. In mainland China, however, the \u4e07\u4e07\u9032 system has continued to be used in the present.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the realm of Buddhist texts, units were devised that could go as high as&nbsp;&nbsp;10^3721838388197764444130659768784964812. This unit is known as \u4e0d\u53ef\u8aac\u4e0d\u53ef\u8aac\u8ee2, and although the number itself is far beyond the realm of practicality or even human comprehension, it and&nbsp;some of the other astronomically large units do happen to be known and utilized in the same way an English speaker might use units like the googolplex. In fact, some units&nbsp;such as&nbsp;\u6052\u6cb3\u6c99 derive from Buddhist texts, but their values are completely different.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u5927\u5b57<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When writing numerals in Kanji, more complicated Kanji that are used for their sound in place of the basic Kanji for said number are known as \u5927\u5b57. The purpose of having more complicated means of writing numbers is to prevent counterfeiting or forging totals, which has been incredibly important in banking, accounting, and the judicial system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have ever seen Japanese currency, you will notice that on any bill containing the numbers 1 and 2 that the Kanji \u4e00 and&nbsp;\u4e8c respectively are not used. In both Japan and China, \u5927\u5b57 exist for 0~10 as well as the units \u767e, \u5343, and \u4e07. Currently, however, the only ones that are mandated by Japanese law for banknotes are the ones for 1, 2, 3, and 10.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the chart below, all \u5927\u5b57 that exist in Japan are listed. Forms will be categorized by whether they are \u65b0\u5b57\u4f53 (new character forms), \u65e7\u5b57\u4f53 (old character forms), or \u4fd7\u5b57 (informal variants).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td><strong>No.<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;Normal \u6f22\u5b57<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>\u65b0\u5b57\u4f53\/<\/strong><strong>Current Form<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;\u65e7\u5b57\u4f53<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;\u4fd7\u5b57<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>0<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3007<\/td><td>\u96f6<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u4e00<\/td><td>\u58f1<\/td><td>\u58f9<\/td><td>\u5f0c<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u4e8c<\/td><td>\u5f10<\/td><td>\u8cb3<\/td><td>\u8cae\u30fb\u5f10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u4e09<\/td><td>\u53c2<\/td><td>\u53c3<\/td><td>&nbsp; &nbsp;\u5f0e<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u56db<\/td><td>\u8086<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u4e94<\/td><td>\u4f0d<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>\u516d<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9678<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>\u4e03<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u6f06\u30fb\u8cea<\/td><td><\/td><td>&nbsp;\u67d2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>\u516b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u634c<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>\u4e5d<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7396<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>\u62fe<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u62fe<\/td><td><\/td><td>&nbsp;\u4ec0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>100<\/td><td>\u767e<\/td><td>&nbsp; &nbsp;\u964c\u30fb\u4f70<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1000<\/td><td>\u5343<\/td><td>&nbsp; &nbsp;\u9621\u30fb\u4edf<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10000<\/td><td>\u4e07<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u842c<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Large Numbers &amp; \u5927\u5b57 In this lesson, we will learn how to create large numbers greater than \u4e00\u5146 (one trillion<a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/imabi.org\/large-numbers-%e5%a4%a7%e5%ad%97\/\">\u7d9a\u304d\u3092\u8aad\u3080 <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">&#8220;Large Numbers &amp; \u5927\u5b57&#8221;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":158153075,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"footnotes":""},"tags":[],"class_list":["post-847","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry"],"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/PeXUlI-dF","jetpack-related-posts":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/847","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/158153075"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=847"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/847\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":5927,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/847\/revisions\/5927"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=847"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=847"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
