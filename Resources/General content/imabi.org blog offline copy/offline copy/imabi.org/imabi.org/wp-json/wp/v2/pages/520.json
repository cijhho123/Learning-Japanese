This is because although &#8220;as one thought&#8221; does a good job at capturing what they&nbsp;generally mean, nuancing often leads to other translations being more accurate depending on the context.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this lesson, we will take a closer look at both words so that you may have a clearer understanding on how to use them. As both of these words are frequently used in both the spoken and written languages, you&#8217;ll certainly need to add them to your vocabulary.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Adverb \u3084\u306f\u308a<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The adverb \u3084\u306f\u308a is heavily used in both the written and spoken language with the meaning of &#8220;just as one thought,&#8221; but there is a wide range of situations in which it can be used in. Its nuances can be summarized into three distinct scenarios.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Emphasizing how something has not changed since last being compared to something else. In this sense, it can be translated as &#8220;as of yet.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Emphasizing how something is just as one predicted. This is synonymous with the adverb \u6848\u306e\u5b9a. However, the latter is more nuanced to refer to &#8220;plans\/situations&#8221; being carried out as predicted.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Emphasizing how something remains the same\/true regardless of how one thinks about it. In this sense, it is synonymous with \u3064\u307e\u308b\u3068\u3053\u308d and \u7d50\u5c40\uff08\u306e\u3068\u3053\u308d\uff09. This can be translated as &#8220;in any case.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either nuance is common in speech and writing. However, it is still possible for \u3084\u306f\u308a to be taken the wrong way if used incorrectly. In either case above, the speaker has in their mind a certain conjecture (\u63a8\u5bdf)&#8211;in other words, \uff5e\u3007\u3007\u3067\u3042\u308d\u3046\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb&#8211;and it turns out that the speaker is right. One&#8217;s past thought is no different than one&#8217;s current thought.

The latter has the additional ability of being used as an adjectival noun.

In this case, though, it would function as an interjection rather than as an adjectival noun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As can be further surmised from what we&#8217;ve seen already, the first usage of \u3055\u3059\u304c is to show appreciation for how the facts line up with one had anticipated or made judgment on.
