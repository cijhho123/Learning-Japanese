The best example of this contrast can be seen with the concept of &#8220;to work.&#8221;<br><br>1a. \u3053\u3053\u3067\u50cd\u3044\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>I&#8217;m working here.<br>1b. \u3053\u3053\u306b\u52e4\u3081\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>I work here.&nbsp;<br><br>1a implies that you are only working somewhere. Perhaps you are a side hand or you are&nbsp;working at&nbsp;a temporary job. Your focus is on the labor and not being a part of the establishment. 1b, on the other hand, implies that you have been at the establishment as an employee for a length of time and that you view yourself as a part of that workplace. While neither 1a nor 1b utilizes &#8220;at&#8221; or &#8220;in,&#8221; they remain the closest words in English to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u306b relates to&nbsp;states of being, whereas&nbsp;\u3067 just relates to occurrences. This&nbsp;is why&nbsp;\u306b is used frequently paired with verbs&nbsp;such as&nbsp;\u3042\u308b (to be (inanimate things)),&nbsp;\u3044\u308b (to be (animate things)), and<em>&nbsp;<\/em>\u52e4\u3081\u308b (to work for) and&nbsp;\u3067 is used&nbsp;frequently paired with verbs such as&nbsp;\u50cd\u304f (to work),&nbsp;\u4f1a\u3046 (to meet), etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u5b66\u6821\u3067\u52c9\u5f37\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>I&#8217;ll study at school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u56f3\u66f8\u9928\u3067\u52c9\u5f37\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I studied at the library.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u99c5\u524d\u3067\u8cb7\u3044\u7269\uff08\u3092\uff09\u3059\u308b\u3002<br>To shop in front of the train station.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. \u4e8b\u52d9\u6240\u3067\u304a\u5ba2\u3055\u3093\u306b\u96fb\u8a71\u3092\u304b\u3051\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>I will make a call at the office to the customer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. \u5f7c\u5973\u306f\u6d77\u3010\u3067 \u3007\u30fb\u306b X\u3011\u6cf3\u3044\u3060\u3002<br>She swam in the sea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Particle Note<\/strong>: \u6d77\u306b\u6cf3\u3050 is incorrect to the majority of speakers.
