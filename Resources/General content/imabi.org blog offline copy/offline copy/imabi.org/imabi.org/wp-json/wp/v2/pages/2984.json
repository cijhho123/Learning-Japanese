The historical discussion that is to follow is <strong>NOT<\/strong> required for you to read or grasp, but it does provide the &#8220;why&#8221; to this dilemma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why \uff5e\u305f\u3044 Takes \u304c<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike when the auxiliary \uff5e\u306a\u3044 attaches itself to verbs, the resulting phrases made with the auxiliary \uff5e\u305f\u3044 do appear to function adjectivally. Yet, the verbal component cannot be overlooked, either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ergativity<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When the subject marker of an intransitive verb manifests as the same morpheme as the object marker of a transitive verb, that verb is said to be an ergative verb. Meaning, the use of \u304c to seemingly mark the object of verbs with \uff5e\u305f\u3044 can be explained without having to posit that the particle \u304c is functioning any differently than it normally does. This is because the ergative nature of the \uff5e\u305f\u3044 construct allows \u304c to remain a subject marker; however, the role that that subject plays, semantically, is parallel to the object of the transitive iteration of the sentence (without \uff5e\u305f\u3044). <br><br>Ergative grammar need not be pervasive to be valid, which is a common misconception for those unfamiliar with the concept, as it is neither found in English nor in many other languages. Its subtle appearance in Japanese grammar can, in fact, be attributed to stative (predicates which describe a state) grammar having a symbiotic relationship with ergative verbal grammar in the broader category of stative-transitive predicates, which we learned about in Lesson 22.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\/po-\/ \u6b32: The Original Morpheme for Desire<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In Old Japanese, \uff5e\u305f\u3044 did not exist, nor did its immediate predecessor \uff5e\u307e\u307b\u3057, which utilizes the older version of \u6b32\u3057\u3044 in its etymology. Desire, at this time, could be described with the root \/po-\/ \u6b32 &#8211; with various affixes to choose from to produce a similar spectrum of options to describe desire as found in Modern Japanese: \/-ru\/, \/-su\/, \/-si\/, and \/-ri-su\/ \u2192 \u6b32\u308b, \u6b32\u3059, \u6b32\u3057, \u6b32\u308a\u3059. From these forms alone, we can already make three observations that directly affect how desire-related phrasing works today. <br><br>\u2460The default means of describing desire is transitive in nature, and is therefore subject to the various affixation that arises with such verbs to fine tune nuancing. <br>\u2461Simultaneously, there too exists an adjectival means of describing a desirable circumstance. In which case, all such adjectives in Japanese are created by affixing \/-shii\/ to the basic transitive verb form. <br>\u2462All these forms are still etymologically related to the modern \u6b32\u3057\u3044, but it is at best a derivative from a verbal root. <br><br>The verb \u6b32\u308b simply worked as &#8220;to desire,&#8221; and it too only depicted personal desire. In practice, its \u9023\u7528\u5f62 was predominantly used, and as what happens from time to time in Japanese morphology, this led to the formation of \u6b32\u308a\u3059 for describing the strong desire of anyone, which eventually gave rise to \u6b32\uff08\u307b\u3063\uff09\u3059, which still exists in Modern Japanese in limited capacity as \u6b32\u3059\u308b, which is notably still a transitive verb. <br><br>All while, there still has always existed the adjectival form \u6b32\u3057, which either depicted a desirable circumstance or the object of one&#8217;s desire. The affix \/-si\/ (equivalent to Modern Japanese \/-shii\/) unequivocally describes emotional state of beings, and in the process, it changes the sentence structure to match accordingly by forming adjectival predicates. <br><br>We even see \u304c work its magic with \u6b32\u3057 in the pattern \uff5e\u304c\u6b32\u3057 when it followed the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 of verbs<sup data-fn=\"032f214f-d1b1-4ef8-9e4b-bdba3301c9e4\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#032f214f-d1b1-4ef8-9e4b-bdba3301c9e4\" id=\"032f214f-d1b1-4ef8-9e4b-bdba3301c9e4-link\">5<\/a><\/sup>, as it functioned precisely the same as \uff5e\u305f\u3044 would in Modern Japanese. The action is portrayed as a desirable state the speaker wishes to be in, all while there is still an object in the sentence being ergatively rendered as the subject of the resulting adjectival expression. <br><br>Adjectival predicates, by nature, do not take, and have never taken, objects marked with \u3092. However, the issue presented when the subject (\u4e3b\u4f53) is stated alongside the grammatical subject of what is desirable is apparent. Yet, if \u6b32\u3057 is analyzed as the ergative rendition of its transitive forms, then a direct parallel can also be made with \uff5e\u305f\u3044. It is both logical for the object of desire to be stated as the subject of a mental state of being and for the constructs used to depict such states to be derived from active transitive verb constructs via ergative grammar. <br><br>Furthermore, Japanese already allows the same case particle to be used consecutively onto a following element so long as it is not functioning <em>exactly<\/em> the same way as the first instance, thus explaining sentences such as:<br><br>52. \u50d5\u304c\u3084\u308a\u305f\u3044\u3093\u3060\uff01<br><em>I <\/em>want to do it! <br><br>The &#8220;it,&#8221; although omitted, is still inherently the object of desired action by the speaker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Etymology of \uff5e\u305f\u3044<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>How, then, did \uff5e\u305f\u3044 come about if it is not directly linked to any derivate of the original morpheme for &#8220;to want&#8221;? <br><br>The going theory suggests that it derives from the amalgamation of the adjective \u751a\uff08\u3044\u305f\uff09\u3057 fusing with the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 of verbs. This adjective had various meanings &#8211; of which &#8220;to be excessive,&#8221; &#8220;to be amazing,&#8221; and &#8220;to be tough (as in a situation)&#8221; &#8211; but for any of these meanings to result in an auxiliary indicating &#8220;desire&#8221; would require a number of leaps in logic for which there are no intermediary stages to prove said trajectory. Indeed, the adjective \u52b4\u305f\u3057 in Classical Japanese meaning &#8220;to be incredibly adorable,&#8221; which does undoubtedly derive from \u751a\u3057, certainly describes a desirable state, but it is notably not describing an emotionally desirable state of being of the speaker, nor in the third-person. <br><br>Another possible route for the emergence of \uff5e\u305f\u3044 can be found in other existing grammar found in Old Japanese: that being the ending \uff5e\u3057\u304c\u306a. This ending either directly followed the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 of verbs or the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 of perfect auxiliary verbs. It indicated a personal yearning of the speaker similarly to how \uff5e\u305f\u3044\u306a\u3042 works in Modern Japanese. Not so surprisingly, we see \uff5e\u3057 present. However, as is made evident from the grammar of sentences which used this sentence ending, the verb structures remained transitive, making it clear that it at least started out as a separate morpheme &#8211; joining the long list of final particles that have littered Japanese sentences since antiquity. <br><br>However, changes based off association have occurred elsewhere in Japanese. The most extreme yet example is the replacement of the auxiliary verb \uff5e\u305a with the auxiliary adjective \uff5e\u306a\u3044. Dialectal conjugations of its predecessor clearly indicate that it did derive from \uff5e\u305a, yet however it happened, we are stuck with an ending that conjugates as an adjective in Modern Japanese.<br><br>Typically, when the affix \/-shii\/ (= \/-si\/ in Classical Japanese) attaches to verbs to create adjectives describing the speaker&#8217;s mental state of desiring something, it does so by attaching itself to the \u672a\u7136\u5f62, as this is the base responsible for states which have yet to occur. Examples include \u671b\u307e\u3057\u3044, \u597d\u307e\u3057\u3044, \u9858\u308f\u3057\u3044, and \u601d\u308f\u3057\u3044, all of which may roughly translate as &#8220;desirable.&#8221; <br><br>What all these verbs share in common is that their \u672a\u7136\u5f62 ends in \/a\/. By association, it is possible that the combination of \u3066, the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 of the perfect auxiliary \u3064 from Classical Japanese, underwent an irregular sound change to sound more like other instances of the adjectival affix \/-si\/ attaching to verbs. Then, by this newly found association, ergative grammar along with functioning as an adjective would both be acquired traits made in the process. Also, by being partially derived from the \u672a\u7136\u5f62 of a perfect auxiliary, the state of being described is then rendered as having yet to happen. <br><br>Ultimately, by Late Middle Japanese, \uff5e\u305f\u3057 &#8211; the direct predecessor of \uff5e\u305f\u3044 &#8211; had supplanted \uff5e\u304c\u307b\u3057 and \uff5e\u307e\u304f\u307b\u3057\uff08\u307e\u307b\u3057\uff09as the auxiliary for personal desire, and through this exchange, it naturally inherited ergativity. <br><br>Subsequently, no sooner than \uff5e\u305f\u3044 had appeared in everyday speech, the use of \u3092 for when \uff5e\u305f\u3044 is paired with transitive verbs has been observed, indicating that the ergative grammar of the ending has never been enough momentum to completely override the transitivity of the verbs themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Grammatical Parallel Examples to \uff5e\u305f\u3044\u30fb\u6b32\u3057\u3044<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>All while this was occurring, other ergative transformations were occurring elsewhere in the Japanese language to once purely transitive constructs for desire &#8211; that being the emergence of \u597d\u304d\u3060 and \u5acc\u3044\u3060 from their verbal forms \u597d\u304f and \u5acc\u3046 respectively, suggesting that transitive verb morphemes have a natural tendency to produce ergative forms which take on adjectival morphology to assist with better marking said relationship via the existing case system of Japanese.<\/p>\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-footnotes\"><li id=\"6f773785-6bb9-4d95-a67f-1c959f4b904e\">The use of \u3092 with [transitive verb + \uff5e\u305f\u3044] has been observed since the Muromachi Period (\u5ba4\u753a\u6642\u4ee3), which matches the time period when the ending itself became widespread.
