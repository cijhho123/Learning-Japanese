Yet, despite \u305b\u307e\u3044 being the historically pure form, its use among modern speakers across dialects is only marginal. Conversely, \u6765\u308b is regular in this regard for maintaining \u3053\u307e\u3044 over \u304d\u307e\u3044, with the latter using \u304d as an alternative \u672a\u7136\u5f62 mirroring \u3057 for \u3059\u308b in the same capacity but never having gained widespread acceptance.
