In English, an indirect object is defined as a word which receives a direct object<sup data-fn=\"28f9974a-24ba-4c5d-8520-de1ec04274b7\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#28f9974a-24ba-4c5d-8520-de1ec04274b7\" id=\"28f9974a-24ba-4c5d-8520-de1ec04274b7-link\">3<\/a><\/sup>, but in Japanese, an indirect object may be best interpreted as an object which is NOT a direct object<sup data-fn=\"94b8b9b5-2fce-44d3-ab4c-7b49dee36c98\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#94b8b9b5-2fce-44d3-ab4c-7b49dee36c98\" id=\"94b8b9b5-2fce-44d3-ab4c-7b49dee36c98-link\">4<\/a><\/sup>. The object more broadly receives an action, so as not to be restricted by the notion of give-and-take, which also helps explain scenarios such as Ex. 34 in which \u306b must appear. In Ex. 34, \u5f7c is both a destination and an entity which receives the act of &#8220;meeting.&#8221; In turn, \u5f7c receives your presence, and it is this notion that is built into the semantics of the verb \u4f1a\u3046.<br><br>Now, let&#8217;s take a look at other scenarios in which \u306b is clearly used as an indirect object marker. Notice how the noun which constitutes as the direct object and the noun which constitutes as the indirect object may flip places due to Japanese&#8217;s flexible word order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>35. \u79c1\u306f\u3044\u3068\u3053<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306b<\/span>\u624b\u7d19\u3092\u66f8\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I wrote a letter to my cousin.<br><br>36. \u30b1\u30a4\u30c8\u3055\u3093\u306f\u30c6\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u541b<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306b<\/span>\u30c1\u30e7\u30b3\u3092\u304f\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>Kate-san gave Taylor-kun chocolate.<br><br>37. \u5618\u306e\u3053\u3068\u3092\u304a\u5ba2\u3055\u3093<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306b<\/span>\u4f1d\u3048\u308b\u3002<br>To tell a lie to a customer.<br><br>In these three examples, the indirect object ought to be viewed as the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">recipient<\/span> of the predicate. For example, in Ex. 37, the recipient of the subject&#8217;s lie is the customer. <br><br>Whenever a sentence does not have a [Noun + \u3092] complement, learners often get confused as to whether what they are looking at is an indirect object. Ultimately, the nature of the predicate dictates this. <br><br>In the bigger picture, \u306b sets up the Establishment for which the predicate is true. If the predicate is existential in nature, then the location marked by \u306b is simply where that state of being resides, with no further dynamic implied. If the predicate indicates a transition, then the noun marked by \u306b is either a destination\/end point\/result &#8211; whether that be a location\/outcome with intransitive verbs or a recipient with transitive verbs. If the predicate indicates a transfer for which there is an addressee\/recipient, then \u306b marks an indirect object. <br><br>In the sentences below, the verbal and adjectival predicates vary wildly in their semantics<sup data-fn=\"9ae4ebdc-06f2-4a3e-96a6-567a587fc51a\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#9ae4ebdc-06f2-4a3e-96a6-567a587fc51a\" id=\"9ae4ebdc-06f2-4a3e-96a6-567a587fc51a-link\">5<\/a><\/sup>, but they all share the commonality of falling under that final category in which the object marked by \u306b is what is being <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">addressed<\/span>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>38.&nbsp;<ruby>\u541b<rt>\u304d\u307f<\/rt><\/ruby><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306b<\/span><ruby>\u96fb\u8a71<rt>\u3067\u3093\u308f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3060\u3088\u3002(Masculine; casual)<br>There&#8217;s a phone call for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>39. \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306b<\/span><ruby>\u71b1\u4e2d<rt>\u306d\u3063\u3061\u3085\u3046<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3059\u308b\u5b50<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306b<\/span>\u5bfe\u3057\u3066\u89aa\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\uff1f<br>What is it that parents can do to confront their kid(s) who is engrossed in games?<br><br>40. \u8cea\u554f<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306b<\/span>\u7b54\u3048\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002<br>Please answer the question.<br><br>41. \u8981\u6c42<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306b<\/span>\u5fdc\u3058\u308b\u3002<br>To comply with a demand.<br><br>42. \u5148\u751f<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306b<\/span>\u805e\u3044\u3066\u307f\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002<br>Please try asking Sensei.<br><br>43. \u8b66\u6212\u5fc3\u306e\u5f37\u3044\u72ac\u306f\u305f\u307e\u306b\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u4eba<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306b<\/span>\u565b\u307f\u3064\u304f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002<br>Dogs with high guard occasionally bite people they do not know.<br><br>44. \u5468\u56f2\u306e\u4eba<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306b<\/span>\u983c\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3002<br>Do you rely on people around you?<br><br>45. \u8a66\u5408<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306b<\/span>\u52dd\u3063\u305f\u3088\u3002<br>I won the match.<br><br>46. \u52a9\u8a5e<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306b<\/span>\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u691c\u7d22\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I searched for information regarding particles.<br><br>47. \u5b50\u4f9b<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306b<\/span>\u512a\u3057\u3044\u592b\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>I want a husband who is nice to kids.<br><br>48. \u79c1\u81ea\u8eab\u306f\u7d50\u69cb\u304a\u9152<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306b<\/span>\u5f31\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>I myself am particularly weak to alcohol.<br><br>49. \u30bb\u30b9\u3055\u3093\u306f\u30ab\u30bf\u30eb\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3\u8a9e<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306b<\/span>\u3082\u8a73\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3088\u3002<br>Seth-san is also knowledgeable in Catalan. <br><br>50. \u306b\u304d\u3073<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u306b<\/span>\u52b9\u304f\u85ac\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>There is medicine that works on pimples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-16018d1d wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-align-center wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/imabi.org\/the-case-particle-%e3%81%ae-i\/\">Previous Lesson<\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-align-center wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/imabi.org\/the-particle-e-%e3%81%b8\/\">Next Lesson<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-footnotes\"><li id=\"cada8c5a-fbec-4fc9-95ea-2ed4842011af\">The notion of Establishment encompasses both spatial, temporal, and the directional state in which the noun marked by \u306b represents that the subject finds itself.
