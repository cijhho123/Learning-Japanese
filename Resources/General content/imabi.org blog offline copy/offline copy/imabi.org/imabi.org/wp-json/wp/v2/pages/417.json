In other words, these words are tied so much to one&#8217;s age as they are to how long people have stayed in a certain role, but that time accumulated often does correlate with age.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid ambiguity, the decision between viewing someone as one&#8217;s \u5148\u8f29 or \u5f8c\u8f29 is made by in which year everyone joined, with the people who entered first being \u5148\u8f29, those who entered later being \u5f8c\u8f29, and those who entered at the same time being \u540c\u671f.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When not tied to education, social groups, or workplace relationships, the use of \u5148\u8f29\u30fb\u5f8c\u8f29 can sound sarcastic or potentially offensive, especially the latter when there is no particular reason to call out someone as &#8216;junior&#8217; as that implies the individual lacks in (life) experience, but that could very well be a grave miscalculation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, there are some interesting set phrases that are created with these terms to relate to everyday life circumstances such as \u4eba\u751f\u306e\u5148\u8f29 (sempai of life)&nbsp;and \u5148\u8f29\u30de\u30de (an experienced mother).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grammatically, \u5148\u8f29\u30fb\u5f8c\u8f29 function like all the other \u656c\u79f0 in this lesson.

In Christianity, it may refer to (arch)bishops and cardinals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u30fb\u5ea7\u4e0b: This \u656c\u79f0 is reserved for bishops below the status of patriarch within the Eastern Orthodox Church.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u30fb\u8056\u4e0b: Translated into English as &#8220;His Holiness,&#8221; its overall usage to refer to the highest ranking religious figure of a sect may conflict with the specific \u656c\u79f0 by the Japanese government. For instance, the Patriarch of Moscow may be referred to with \u8056\u4e0b, but the Pope of the Catholic Church, is only referred to with \u53f0\u4e0b.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u4e3b\u4e0a\u30fb\u8056\u4e0a\u30fb\u5973\u5c06<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u4e3b\u4e0a\uff08\u3057\u3085\u3058\u3087\u3046\uff09and \u8056\u4e0a\uff08\u305b\u3044\u3058\u3087\u3046\uff09both exist as \u656c\u79f0 for addressing the emperor. Historically, the KUN reading of both these words is \u304a\u304b\u307f, which was used to refer to the emperor up until Emperor Showa. Although members of the Imperial Household Agency (\u5bae\u5185\u5e81) may still use it, these words are replaced with other forms of address by commoners including \u5e1d\uff08\u307f\u304b\u3069\uff09and \u304a\u5185\u88cf\u69d8.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The spellings \u5fa1\u4e0a and \u5973\u5c06 of \u304a\u304b\u307f are still etymologically tied to the same word.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u5fa1\u4e0a may still refer to the emperor, but it usually refers to the government as a whole. From that usage, it also expanded to &#8220;one&#8217;s master&#8221; and then by extension &#8220;proprietor\/proprietress.&#8221; In the female connotation of the latter, the spelling \u5973\u5c06 is preferred. From that meaning, it was also once used as a formal address towards someone&#8217;s wife in a dignified manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u5e2b\u5320<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u5e2b\u5320 is a quintessential to many professions \u656c\u79f0&nbsp;meaning &#8220;master\/teacher&#8221; and can often be viewed as interchangeable with \u5148\u751f. There are certain scenarios, however, in which \u5e2b\u5320 is obligatory.
