In other words, the agent is in control of what happens to said direct object. This relationship is what is at play when the case particle \u3092 marks the direct object.<br><br>Incidentally, intransitive verbs (\u81ea\u52d5\u8a5e) may still possess an active agent despite not having a direct object or necessarily even imply control over the situation by said agent. This facet of intransitive verbs plays a major role when the case particle \u3092 is combined with them, because instead of marking a direct object, it marks a point of transition within some medium. This medium may be &#8220;through&#8221; time, space, or even degree. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Motion Through All\/Part of a Dimension<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Transitioning through a dimension of space is one of the most important applications of the transition marker&nbsp;\u3092. To visualize how this works, think of a circle and an arrow going through it. The action at hand happens anywhere throughout the space&nbsp;\u3092 marks. Transition-wise, it may equate to various English phrases such as \u201calong,\u201d \u201cthrough,\u201d and \u201cacross.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u3092\u767b\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I climbed Mt.

However, the particle&nbsp;\u3092 says nothing about destination or what may happen internally within a certain dimension. Those situations are handled by other particles. The verb&nbsp;\u884c\u304f means \u201cto go,\u201d and is frequently described as taking the particle&nbsp;\u306b, which indicates destination.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. \u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u306b\u884c\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I went to the supermarket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it too can be used with the particle&nbsp;\u3092.

The action could be done towards or around some entity, with the entity being broadened to include direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11. \u89d2\u3092\u66f2\u304c\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>I turned the corner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12. \u5468\u308a\u3092\u56de\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>I circled around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Noun&nbsp;\u65b9<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The noun&nbsp;\u65b9, frequently spelled simply as \u307b\u3046, is used to help&nbsp;\u3092 create the meaning of \u201ctoward\u201d with verbs pertaining to directing one\u2019s sight. The insertion of&nbsp;\u307b\u3046 is imperative whenever the noun it precedes is not a literal direction-word (north, south, east, and west).

Although these individual applications are all interrelated, they are different enough to the point that more than one can manifest in a sentence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have also seen how the same particle can easily be used more than once in a sentence even in the same clause, as is frequently the case with the particles&nbsp;\u304c and&nbsp;\u306f. In those discussions, the word sentence was used in place of clause, but clause is simply one stage below a sentence in terms of grammar. Clauses come in two kinds: independent and dependent. An independent clause is something that can stand alone as a proper sentence, whereas a dependent clause cannot stand alone as a sentence. A clause, nonetheless, will always have the same hallmarks of a sentence in regards to composition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for&nbsp;\u3092, it is possible to have two usages of the transition marker function manifest in a single clause. In Ex. 16, the first&nbsp;\u3092 marks the direction of the action of \u201cto walk.\u201d The subject walked \u201cin\u201d the rain. The second&nbsp;\u3092 marks the dimension of transit, which is \u201cthrough\u201d the park. There is a principle of Japanese grammar, however, that aims to avoid such doubling of case particles. Because of this, the first such&nbsp;\u3092 is usually left omitted despite grammatically still being there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>16. \u96e8\u306e\u4e2d\uff08\u3092\uff09\u3001\u516c\u5712\u3092\u6b69\u3044\u305f\u3002<br>I walked through the park in the rain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Origin of Departure<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The transition marker&nbsp;\u3092 may also mark what the agent is departing from. In this sense, it is interchangeable with the case particle&nbsp;\u304b\u3089. This is only true, however, for when the point of departure is a physical, concrete location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>17a. \u96fb\u8eca\u3092\u964d\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>17b. \u96fb\u8eca\u304b\u3089\u964d\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>17a. I got off the train.<br>17b. I disembarked from the train.<br><br>In both 17a. and 17b., \u964d\u308a\u308b accounts for the action of \u201cgetting off the train.\u201d As for the particle \u3092 in 17a. \u96fb\u8eca is simply the point of departure, with no further nuancing. Meanwhile, the particle \u304b\u3089 in 17b. denotes \u96fb\u8eca as the origin point for what follows, and there is a far stronger sense of removing oneself (\u96e2\u308c\u308b) from the train.<br><br>The interpretations of 17a. and 17b. are made possible by the noun \u96fb\u8eca being as concrete and commonplace as a noun can be. As such, even with there still being a subtle difference, the interchangeability between the two particles is undeniable. However, what happens to the nuancing of these particles if the noun in question is potentially abstract?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>18a. \u5bb6\u3092\u51fa\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>18b. \u5bb6\u304b\u3089\u51fa\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>18a. I left home.<br>18b. I left my house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>18a. has two possible interpretations: leaving the home (to live independently) or leaving the home as a point of departure\u2014both situations implying an abstract notion of \u201cleaving\u201d or \u201cheading out.\u201d 18b., however, merely indicates the physical act of exiting the home, with neither of the nuances 18a. has.<br><br>These interpretations are made possible by \u5bb6 not always simply only referring to the literal structure of the \u201chouse.\u201d Indeed, we find in practice that although 18b. is possible for that literal meaning of \u201cexiting\u201d the home, reading \u5bb6 as \u3046\u3061, a separate noun altogether which happens to share the same spelling, returns us back to the default understanding of \u3092\u30fb\u304b\u3089 with concrete nouns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>19. \u3010\u59bb\u30fb\u4e3b\u4eba\u3011\u306f7\u6642\u306b\u5bb6\u3092\u51fa\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>My wife\/husband left home at seven o\u2019 clock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If instead \u304b\u3089 were used, we would imagine the agent carrying out some sort of itinerary with the home being the point of origin or more literally removing oneself from the home. Meanwhile, \u3092 denotes the home as just a departure point with no strings attached to its interpretation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>20a. \u8239\u304c\u6e2f\u3092\u51fa\u767a\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>20b. \u8239\u304c\u6e2f\u304b\u3089\u51fa\u767a\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>20a. The boat left the harbor.<br>20b. The boat disembarked from the harbor.<br><br>Incidentally, it is just as possible for the particles \u3092 and \u304b\u3089 to be used in tandem with both referencing departure. This interaction can be best seen in examples like the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>21. \u30b7\u30a2\u30c8\u30eb\u30bf\u30b3\u30de\u56fd\u969b\u7a7a\u6e2f\u304b\u3089\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u3092\u51fa\u767a\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I departed America from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we have seen how the concreteness of the noun in question can affect how \u3092\u30fb\u304b\u3089 are interpreted, it must be noted that the particle \u306b is not interchangeable with them. In Ex. 22. \u306b indicates that the outside is the point of arrival, which is the opposite function that \u3092\u30fb\u304b\u3089 possess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>22. \u5916\u306b\u51fa\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I went outside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With interchangeability also comes situations in which it fails. For verbs such as \u5352\u696d\u3059\u308b (to graduate) and \u8f9e\u3081\u308b (to quit a job) where the point of departure is not viewed as a starting point of an action but the conclusion of one\u2019s course of action, only \u3092 is possible. Yet, as similar as these two examples are, their transitivity is actually different. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Ex. 23, \u5352\u696d\u3059\u308b is, in fact, intransitive because the agent (doer) does not affect an object. Nothing comes about to the college from the student graduating from it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>23. \u53bb\u5e74\u5927\u5b66\uff5b\u3092 \u3007\u30fb\u304b\u3089 X\uff5d\u5352\u696d\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I graduated (from) college last year.<br><br>Meanwhile, Ex. 24 is an example of the typical direct object marker \u3092 because the agent (doer) does affect the company by quitting. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>24. \u4f1a\u793e{\u3092 \u3007\u30fb\u304b\u3089 X}\u8f9e\u3081\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I quit the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Flux in Degree<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a handful of verbs in Japanese that pertain to fluctuation in degree.

The reason why it would appear in a sentence like Ex. 29 is to emphasize the fact that the suspect was hiding for ten years.
