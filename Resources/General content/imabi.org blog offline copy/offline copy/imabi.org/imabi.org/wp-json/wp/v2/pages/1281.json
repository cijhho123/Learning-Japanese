Yes, even \u306e was seen for the function of marking the subject. Another odd thing was that the simple sentence did not need \u304c. This is because in the ancient period this usage didn&#8217;t exist. The first usage of \u304c was to mark an attribute like \u306e. From there it began being used as a subject marker, and then it started taking on conjunctive usages.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember that a case particle shows some sort of relationship between the preceding NOMINAL phrase that it modifies and the rest of the sentence. Have you noticed that they are always nominal phrases? Well, what may cause you confusion with Classical Japanese is how these particles seemingly follow right after a verb. However, the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 was able to be used as a nominalized part of speech. Thus, the only difference here is how this relation is marked. This phenomenon is called \u9023\u4f53\u5f62\u306e\u6e96\u4f53\u6cd5. It is no longer done today for the most part. However, you can still see things like \uff5e\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304c\u3044\u3044. Even then the pattern is considered old-fashioned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u3000\u3000Just as \u304c can mark the subject (\u4e3b\u683c), it can also mark an attribute just like \u306e (<ruby>\u9023\u4f53\u4fee\u98fe\u683c<rt>\u308c\u3093\u305f\u3044\u3057\u3085\u3046\u3057\u3087\u304f\u304b\u304f<\/rt><\/ruby>). There are still cases where \u304c does this today. This usage is very common in place names, and it is seen in older expressions like \u6211\u304c\u56fd. As far as names are concerned, you might not recognize that its \u304c because it is often spelled as \u30f6. For example, think of places like&nbsp;<ruby>\u95a2<rt>\u305b\u304d<\/rt><\/ruby><ruby>\u30f6<rt>\u304c<\/rt><\/ruby><ruby>\u539f<rt>\u306f\u3089<\/rt><\/ruby>, which was where a crucial battle in 1600 marked the start of the&nbsp;<ruby>\u5fb3\u5ddd\u5e55\u5e9c<rt>\u3068\u304f\u304c\u308f\u3070\u304f\u3075<\/rt><\/ruby>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u3000\u3000\u3000Two other usages that differ from Modern Japanese are showing an implied nominal, similar to what \u306e can do today, and show apposition (\u540c\u683c). This usage is rather odd from appearance if you were brand new to Classical Japanese. It should not be confused as &#8220;but&#8221;. Remember that all of the usages up to now are classified as case particle usages. After all, the conjunctive usages were the last to evolve, as is the case for other particles as well.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Examples<\/u><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;<ruby>\u6e05\u898b<rt>\u304d\u3088\u307f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c<ruby>\u95a2<rt>\u305b\u304d<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3092<ruby>\u904e<rt>\u3059<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3050\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; We pass the barrier at Kiyomi.<br>From the&nbsp;<ruby>\u5341\u516d\u591c<rt>\u3044\u3056\u3088\u3072<\/rt><\/ruby>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u3059\u305a\u3081\u306e<ruby>\u5b50<rt>\u3053<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3092\u3001<ruby>\u72ac<rt>\u3044\u306c<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304d\u304c<ruby>\u9003<rt>\u306b<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c\u3057\u3064\u308b\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Inuki let the baby sparrow escape.<br>From the \u6e90\u6c0f\u7269\u8a9e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u541b\u4e4b\u884c \u6c23\u9577\u6210\u5974 \u5c71\u591a\u90fd\u7962 \u8fce\u52a0\u5c06\u884c \u5f85\u5c13\u53ef\u5c06\u5f85\u3000(\u539f\u6587)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; \u541b\u304c\u884c\u304d<ruby>\u65e5<rt>\u3051<\/rt><\/ruby>\u9577\u304f\u306a\u308a\u5c71\u305f\u3065\u306d<ruby>\u8fce<rt>\u3080\u304b<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3078\u884c\u304b\u3080\u5f85\u3061\u306b\u304b\u5f85\u305f\u3080<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#8217;s been a while since he left.

It can also be used with the causative. All of these examples are in Modern Japanese, but they&#8217;re usages that were also used in Classical Japanese. Notice that all but the first were used with intransitive verbs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u3000\u3000\u3000There are a few usages of \u3092 that are not so in Modern Japanese.

It is rather old. In fact, most of the occurrences of this pattern were in the \u5948\u826f\u6642\u4ee3. Many sources actually classify this as an interjectory particle. A problem with this theory is how similar \u307f is to a \u9023\u7528\u5f62 of a verb. Although you can&#8217;t just make a verb out of any adjective by sending it to the stem and adding \u3080, there are some that appear to be made as such. For example, \u60dc\u3057\u3044\u3000= regrettable and \u60dc\u3057\u3080 = to regret. It&#8217;s not uncommon for a language to have a construction be limited. So, when you treat \u307f as a \u9023\u7528\u5f62, it makes the pattern a lot easier to remember.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Particle Note<\/strong>: Remember that \u3092\uff0b\u306f \uff1d\u3000\u3092\u3070. This combination is extremely common in Classical Japanese. In some dialects this pattern resulted in the object marker becoming \u3070 altogether, having dropped the initial \u3092.
