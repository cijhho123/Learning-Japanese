There are two solutions to this ambiguity: the surrounding context (visual and\/or textual) or supplementing the main clause with a modifier that clearly rules out one of the interpretations. <br><br>The second solution is arguably the easier route, as is demonstrated by Exs. 23b\u2013c.<br><br>23b.

Meaning II, meanwhile, would make sense in the context of weight class, albeit a heavily overweight class. <br><br>Ranges pertaining to time, space, or degree, on the other hand, are not ambiguous like this.

X<br><br>In Exs. 28 and 29, notice how people and things are treated as a set within the same range. Moreover, what makes them so unnatural is how the &#8220;X to Y&#8221; ranges attributed leave too many questions about what actually defines the set. In both sentences, it is as if the speaker were trying to redefine the elements of the set outlined by X\u304b\u3089Y\u307e\u3067\u2014within it in Ex. 28 and externally before even stating the set in Ex. 29. Ultimately, word order and &#8220;tangible&#8221; set boundaries are not flexible when using \u307e\u3067, which is also corroborated by Exs. 23\u201324 from earlier.<br><br>The grammaticality of these tangible sets is also based on practicality just as much as they are by syntactic restrictions.

That being said, let&#8217;s break each one of these iterations down.<br><br>30a. is just as unnatural as 30d, but what 30a implies is a tad bit more likely to rationalize. 30a sounds as though the speaker is viewing X (Plato) and Y (Sartre) on a contiguous line of progress, which would make sense if the speaker were meticulously studying philosophy books one by one and viewed X (Plato) definitely as the starting point and Sartre as either the definitive end point or the extent to which the speaker has studied. The ambiguity of the end point and the oddness of the speaker viewing X as the definitive start of the range add to the unnaturalness of the statement. <br>30b. is ungrammatical because of how [\u54f2\u5b66\u306e\u672c\u30d7\u30e9\u30c8\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u30b5\u30eb\u30c8\u30eb\u307e\u3067] is treated definitively as the set which is philosophy books, when in reality, a speaker would know that [\u30d7\u30e9\u30c8\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u30b5\u30eb\u30c8\u30eb\u307e\u3067] cannot be the definitive bounds of [\u54f2\u5b66\u306e\u672c], yet here this range is defining the head of the expression [\u54f2\u5b66\u306e\u672c] as if it were. <br>30c. While this ought to be just as ungrammatical as 30b., the reason why it gets more of a pass is because the speaker makes it clear that, despite the incorrect implication of the statement, the speaker is very much under the impression that [\u54f2\u5b66\u306e\u672c] = [\u54f2\u5b66\u306e\u672c\u30d7\u30e9\u30c8\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u30b5\u30eb\u30c8\u30eb\u307e\u3067]. <br>30d. Here, we see that [\u30d7\u30e9\u30c8\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u30b5\u30eb\u30c8\u30eb\u307e\u3067] is modifying the head of the expression [\u54f2\u5b66\u306e\u672c]. By doing so, the set is unambiguously defined as not philosophy books as a whole, but rather the exact set of philosophy books from Plato to Sartre is what the speaker read. 30d is more unnatural than even Ex. 28 is because of how impractical the feat is. Provided the set of books composing X to Y could be adequately conceptualized, 30d itself would remain grammatical, but its impracticality begs to question the validity of the set itself, thus defeating the purpose of using X\u304b\u3089Y\u307e\u3067.<br>30e. Here, [\u30d7\u30e9\u30c8\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u30b5\u30eb\u30c8\u30eb\u307e\u3067] sets an open-ended range\u2013with the understanding that all sorts of other examples are part of the set\u2013with which the speaker (agent) read [\u54f2\u5b66\u306e\u672c], which is both logical and sound without erroneously making any strange rationalizations about the set itself. Sentences like this demonstrate how \u307e\u3067 phrases behave adverbially, and in this case, [\u30d7\u30e9\u30c8\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u30b5\u30eb\u30c8\u30eb\u307e\u3067] modifies the predicate \u8aad\u3093\u3060. This is also the case in 30f.<br><br>30f. \u30d7\u30e9\u30c8\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u30b5\u30eb\u30c8\u30eb\u307e\u3067\u8aad\u3093\u3060\u3002<br>I&#8217;ve read from Plato to Sartre. <br><br>If, in 30a., the range [\u30d7\u30e9\u30c8\u30f3\u304b\u3089\u30b5\u30eb\u30c8\u30eb\u307e\u3067] were qualified with a counter phrase, the unnaturalness would disappear, as the range and counter phrase would be one of the same thing, relying heavily on the adverbial nature of \u307e\u3067.
