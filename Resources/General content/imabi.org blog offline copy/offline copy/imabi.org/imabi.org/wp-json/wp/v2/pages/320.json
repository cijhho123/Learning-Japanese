Even if they are meeting to talk about a certain agenda, it is customary to first recognize each other, whether by making eye-contact, waving one&#8217;s hand, or using an interjection like \u3084\u3042. Then, once both parties do start talking, they do so by using the appropriate\uff08\u3054\uff09\u6328\u62f6, and before getting into the heart of discussion, they might talk about how they have been or how the weather is first. When it is time to leave, speakers will end the conversation with a farewell <em>aisatsu<\/em> (\u5225\u308c\u306e\u6328\u62f6). These phrases tend to be shorter than \u6328\u62f6 used at the start of a conversation, but there is more at stake if you mess those phrases up as it may determine whether or not you continue seeing the other person on good terms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this lesson, we will be returning to \u6328\u62f6\u306e\u8a00\u8449 used primarily when meeting people for the first time, meeting people for the first time in a long time, and when congratulating others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>Aisatsu<\/em>&nbsp;for First Encounters <br>\u521d\u5bfe\u9762\u306e\u6328\u62f6\uff08\u81ea\u5df1\u7d39\u4ecb\uff09<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When people meet each other for the first time, it is customary to use the phrase \u521d\u3081\u307e\u3057\u3066.

My hobby is listening to Vocaloid music, and I often do things like add subtitles to SNS videos so that people abroad can understand them.&nbsp;<br>Thank you for all allowing me to participate at this occasion.<br>Thank you for your time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to note is how to say &#8220;nice to meet everyone&#8221; as opposed to just &#8220;nice to meet you.&#8221; To do this, you precede&nbsp;\u521d\u3081\u307e\u3057\u3066 with the appropriate phrase for &#8220;everyone&#8221; based on the formality of the situation. If the occasion is very casual, you will&nbsp;hear&nbsp;\u307f\u3093\u306a. If the occasion is formal but not overly so, you will hear&nbsp;\u307f\u306a\u3055\u3093. If the occasion is overly formal, you&#8217;ll hear \u7686\u3055\u307e. In very formal, business writing, you may see&nbsp;\u7686\u69d8\u65b9.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some native speakers, but mostly foreign learners, have the bad habit of preceding or following \u306f\u3058\u3081\u307e\u3057\u3066 with daily greeting phrases such as \u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f or \u3053\u3093\u3070\u3093\u306f. Although doing so in English is commonplace, these phrases happen to be used with people that you already know and&nbsp;not with people you are meeting for the first time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When saying your name in polite contexts, you have the choice of either using \u3067\u3059 or \u3068\u7533\u3057\u307e\u3059, with the latter being more formal. In casual situations, you could simply say,&nbsp;&#8220;(\u540d\u524d\u306f\uff09+ name.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2a. \u540d\u524d\u306f\u7530\u4e2d\u826f\u5e73\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>(My) name is Ryohei Tanaka.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2b.\uff08\u79c1\u306f\uff09\u7530\u4e2d\u826f\u5e73\u3010\u3067\u3059\u30fb\u3068\u8a00\u3044\u307e\u3059\u30fb\u3068\u7533\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3011\u3002<br>I&#8217;m Ryohei Tanaka.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we see that \u3068\u8a00\u3044\u307e\u3059 is intermediary in politeness between \u3067\u3059 and \u3068\u7533\u3057\u307e\u3059.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Degree of formality can often be slightly altered by switching out the form of the last word. For instance, the verb \u3044\u308b used here in the construction \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059 to represent the progressive\/perfect tenses, may be replaced with the more humble verb \u304a\u308a\u307e\u3059. There is no change in meaning to the sentence, but using the latter makes the sentence more formal. The same goes for replacing \u3057\u307e\u3059 with its humble alternatives \uff08\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059\u30fb\u7533\u3057\u4e0a\u3052\u307e\u3059\uff09.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The phrase \uff08\u672c\u65e5\u306f\uff09\uff08\u3069\u3046\u305e\uff09\u3088\u308d\u3057\u304f\u304a\u9858\u3044\u3010\u3057\u307e\u3059\u30fb\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059\u30fb\u7533\u3057\u4e0a\u3052\u307e\u3059\u3011is customarily seen at the end of a greeting, and its appearance changes wildly depending on formality.&nbsp;Meaning-wise, it is asking the listener(s) to kindly keep the speaker on good terms in their mind. If the interaction is a one-time thing as is implied by this example introduction, it may translate into English as &#8220;thank you for your time,&#8221; but if you are using it toward someone you will be working with or be around for the foreseeable future, it translates more as, &#8220;best regards.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In casual circumstances (such as kids or young people meeting someone new of their same age group), \u3088\u308d\u3057\u304f alone can be used. In formal language, \u3069\u3046\u305e meaning &#8220;please&#8221; (see below) is often inserted at the start of the phrase. Typically, either \u3057\u307e\u3059 or \u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059 are perfectly fine both in the spoken and written language, but when you&#8217;re trying to be extra formal, especially in writing, you may also end it with \u7533\u3057\u4e0a\u3052\u307e\u3059.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, it is not a requirement that \u306f\u3058\u3081\u307e\u3057\u3066 be used in a full-blown introduction. You may wish to repeat part of a previous introduction such as in Exs. 2 and 3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u6539\u3081\u3066\u306f\u3058\u3081\u307e\u3057\u3066\u9234\u6728\u3068\u7533\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>Again, it is a pleasure to meet you; my name is Suzuki.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u3061\u3083\u3093\u3068\u304a\u8a71\u3057\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3088\u306d\u3002\u6539\u3081\u3066\u3088\u308d\u3057\u304f\u304a\u9858\u3044\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>We haven&#8217;t really talked yet, have we? Once again, it&#8217;s a pleasure.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a one-on-one encounter, it is appropriate to mimic to what degree the other person has introduced themselves. In most one-on-one encounters, there is often a mutual acquaintance that has provided both parties with general knowledge of the other person. In such a situation, a natural response may look like the following.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. \u306f\u3058\u3081\u307e\u3057\u3066\u3001\u767e\u5408\u5b50\u3010\u3067\u3059\u30fb\u3068\u7533\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3011\u3002<br>\u3053\u3061\u3089\u3053\u305d\u3088\u308d\u3057\u304f\u304a\u9858\u3044\u3010\u3057\u307e\u3059\u30fb\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3011\u3002<br>Nice to meet you; my name is Yuriko.<br>It&#8217;s very nice to meet you too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a business situation, \u3053\u3061\u3089\u3053\u305d\u3088\u308d\u3057\u304f\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb may be interpreted as &#8220;I, too, look forward to working with you.&#8221; Since English does not have a similar expression, how to translate it will be based on the circumstance. However, to the Japanese mind, it is just one expression used out of formality when returning the gesture of being greeted.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, \u306f\u3058\u3081\u307e\u3057\u3066 may be generally used as the polite form of \u306f\u3058\u3081\u3066 in the sense of &#8220;first-time.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. \u306f\u3058\u3081\u307e\u3057\u3066\u306e\u65b9\u3005\u306f\u3053\u308c\u3092\u6a5f\u4f1a\u306b\u3088\u308d\u3057\u304f\u304a\u9858\u3044\u3010\u3057\u307e\u3059\u30fb\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3011\u3002<br>For those of whom this is their first time, please take this as an opportunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Word Note<\/strong>: \u65b9\u3005 is the polite form of&nbsp;\u4eba\u3005 meaning &#8220;people.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, we also see that \u3088\u308d\u3057\u304f\u304a\u9858\u3044\u3010\u3057\u307e\u3059\u30fb\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3011can be used in situations other than introduction. In this example, the speaker is asking the audience kindly to take up on the opportunity being presented.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In formal situations in actual introductions, many speakers will opt to use the more formal\u3010\u306f\u3058\u3081\u3066\u30fb\u304a\u521d\u306b\u3011\u304a\u76ee\u306b\u304b\u304b\u308a\u307e\u3059, which literally refers to oneself being seen by the eyes of the other person for the first time.
