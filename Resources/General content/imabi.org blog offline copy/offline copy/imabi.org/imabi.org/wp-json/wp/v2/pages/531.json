For comparison and contrast, let&#8217;s take a close look at three verbs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Intransitive<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;Transitive<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;Dual Transitivity<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\u8001\u673d\u5316\u3059\u308b<br>To deteriorate<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u6620\u753b\u5316\u3059\u308bTo cinemize<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u6a5f\u68b0\u5316\u3059\u308bTo mechanize<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If we strip away \u3059\u308b, allowing us to look at the standalone nouns, and then translate them back into English, we get &#8220;deterioration,&#8221; &#8220;cinemization,&#8221; and &#8220;mechanization&#8221; respectively.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, let&#8217;s look at \u8001\u673d\u5316\u3059\u308b. Although &#8220;deteriorate&#8221; can be used as a dual transitivity verb in English, the Japanese equivalent cannot. This is likely due to&nbsp;\u8001\u673d\u3059\u308b, its \u5316-less verb form is solely intransitive. As for the nuance difference between \u8001\u673d\u3059\u308b and \u8001\u673d\u5316\u3059\u308b, the former describes the natural process of something becoming old and losing its utility, and the latter describes a systematic process in which something is aging with the problem being viewed as a problem to contend with. It is possible, however, to turn these expressions into transitive verbs. To do so, we must use the causative form. Thus,&nbsp;<strong>whenever a \uff5e\u5316 expression is naturally intransitive, the causative form is necessary to &#8216;make&#8217; it transitive<\/strong>. Consequently, \u8001\u673d\u5316\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3053\u3068 would be &#8220;the act of letting (something) fall into a state of deterioration.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. \u65bd\u8a2d\u7dad\u6301\u3092\u6020\u6162\u3057\u3066\u3001<strong>\u8001\u673d\u5316\u3055\u305b\u305f<\/strong>\u3088\u3046\u306b\u898b\u53d7\u3051\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3002<br>It is assumed from appearance that (they) have caused it to deteriorate by neglecting facility maintenance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7.&nbsp;<strong>\u8001\u673d\u5316\u3057\u305f<\/strong>\u6a4b\u304c\u591a\u304f\u3042\u308b\u3002<br>There are many deteriorating bridges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we have \u6620\u753b\u5316\u3059\u308b. This expression is synonymous with \u6620\u753b\u306b\u3059\u308b. In a way, \uff5e\u5316 can be viewed as a fancier alternative to using the particle \u306b.&nbsp;This verb is transitive in nature. To make it intransitive in nature, the passive form would have to be used. Thus, in English we would get &#8220;to be cinemized,&#8221; and in Japanese, we would get \u6620\u753b\u5316\u3055\u308c\u308b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion from this is that&nbsp;<strong>whenever a \uff5e\u5316 expression is naturally transitive, the passive form is necessary for it to &#8216;become&#8217; intransitive.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. \u4eba\u6c17\u306e\u5c0f\u8aac\u3092<strong>\u6620\u753b\u5316\u3057\u305f<\/strong>\u4f5c\u54c1\u306f\u5b89\u5b9a\u306e\u9762\u767d\u3055\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3002<br>Works made by cinemizing popular novels have a steady level of interest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9. \u6700\u65b0\u306e<strong>\u6620\u753b\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f<\/strong>\u5c0f\u8aac\u3092\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u307f\u3088\u3046\u3002<br>Let&#8217;s read the latest novel to be cinemized.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s far more common in Japanese are expressions that can be either transitive or intransitive depending on the context. To determine the transitivity intended, we will need to look out for the particle \u304c for the intransitive sense and the particle \u3092 for the transitive sense. In English, &#8220;-ize&#8221; results in a transitive verb, and to return it to an intransitive state, the passive form is necessary. In Japanese, though, these dual transitive expressions don&#8217;t necessitate the passive and causative forms by default, both those forms do exist nonetheless to serve their original purposes. To visualize these four scenarios, consider the following examples with \u6a5f\u68b0\u5316\u3059\u308b.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10. \u4eba\u9593\u306e\u8eab\u4f53\u3092\u4e00\u90e8\u6a5f\u68b0\u5316\u3057\u3066\u3082\u4eba\u9593\u3067\u3059\u3088\u306d\uff1f<br>Even if you turn part of the human body into machine, that&#8217;s still a person, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11. \u4eba\u9593\u304c\u6a5f\u68b0\u5316\u3057\u305f\u4e16\u754c\u304c\u6765\u308b\u3068\u3057\u305f\u3089\u3001\u305d\u306e\u5148\u306b\u4f55\u304c\u3042\u308b\u306e\u304b\uff1f<br>If a world in which mankind were to become machines came about, what would that future hold?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12. 1960\u5e74\u4ee3\u306e\u4e2d\u3054\u308d\u304b\u3089\u6a5f\u68b0\u5316\u304c\u3069\u3093\u3069\u3093\u9032\u307f\u30011980\u5e74\u4ee3\u4ee5\u964d\u3001\u3088\u3046\u3084\u304f\u8fb2\u4f5c\u696d\u304c\u5b8c\u5168\u306b\u6a5f\u68b0\u5316\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002&nbsp;<br>Mechanization began in the mid-1960s and gradually progressed, then from the 1980s onward, farm work at long last was entirely mechanized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13. \u5f37\u5236\u7684\u306a\u6a5f\u68b0\u5316\u3092\u63a8\u3057\u9032\u3081\u308b\u5b87\u5b99\u4eba\u306f\u3001\u305d\u306e\u60d1\u661f\u306e\u4f4f\u6c11\u305f\u3061\u3092\u902e\u6355\u3057\u3001\u6b21\u3005\u3068\u6a5f\u68b0\u5316\u3055\u305b\u305f\u3002<br>Aliens forging ahead with compulsive mechanization arrested the residents of that planet and forced them to become machines one after another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Japanese verbs when viewed in totality hardly ever exhibit dual transitivity. With a few exceptional verbs such as \u958b\uff08\u3072\u3089\uff09\u304f (to open) and \u5897\u3059 (to increase), most verbs are either solely intransitive or solely transitive, and if semantically reasonable, they may have an alternative form for the other role. \uff5e\u5316 verbs appear quite exceptional to this rule of thumb. The overwhelming majority of them exhibit this dual transitivity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for why the passive and causative form still exist for these verbs should be apparent from the previous examples. The passive form implies that there was an agent (doer) which sought the process described. Agriculture doesn&#8217;t mechanize by itself. People are ultimately responsible. However, in Ex. 11 where we see \u6a5f\u68b0\u5316\u3059\u308b used as a standalone intransitive verb, the meaning is identical &#8220;to become machines.&#8221; Although becoming a machine would necessitate a willful process, the emphasis is on &#8220;becoming that state.&#8221; Similarly, if mechanization is forced upon someone, that necessitates the use of the causative form to highlight that coercion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">50\/50 Intransitive-Transitive Examples\u3000\u3000\u81ea\u4ed6\u62ee\u6297\u8a9e\u7fa4<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of \uff5e\u5316\u3059\u308b verbs lean towards being used as intransitive verbs due to how having mostly entered the language from Sino-Japanese vocabulary.
