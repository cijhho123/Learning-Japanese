Mood, in grammar, may be described as any inflectional ending that describes the speaker&#8217;s attitude toward the situation at hand. As such, &#8220;mood&#8221; is highly subject to context. In understanding how the mood marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060 functions, much of our discussion will be how much of these following nuances are inherit to itself or borne from the context at large.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"895\" data-attachment-id=\"9954\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/imabi.org\/the-mood-marker-%ef%bd%9e%e3%81%ae%e3%81%a0\/image-3\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/image.png?fit=2688%2C2672&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2688,2672\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/image.png?fit=300%2C298&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/image.png?fit=900%2C895&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/image.png?resize=900%2C895&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9954\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/image.png?resize=1024%2C1018&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/image.png?resize=300%2C298&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/image.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/image.png?resize=768%2C763&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/image.png?resize=1536%2C1527&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/image.png?resize=2048%2C2036&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/image.png?resize=200%2C200&amp;ssl=1 200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/image.png?resize=1200%2C1193&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/image.png?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/image.png?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To play the devil&#8217;s advocate, though, let&#8217;s review once more what the terms &#8220;scope&#8221; and &#8220;mood&#8221; mean in the context of Japanese sentence structure and how that affects \uff5e\u306e\u3060&#8217;s placement in it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, the nominalizing effect \uff5e\u306e\u3060 has and its being part of the predicate are both intrinsic features. Secondly, Japanese sentence structure itself exhibits a strict hierarchy for what goes inside the predicate:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">VERB STEM + VOICE + VOLITION + ASPECT + NEGATION + TENSE + MOOD<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Meaning, \uff5e\u306e\u3060&#8217;s placement at the end both solidifies its position and functionality within a sentence. This can be demonstrated by the phrase: <br><br>\u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3089\u3057\u3044\u3093\u3060\u306d . <br>Gloss: Eat-passive-volition-progressive-negation-past tense-mood (seems)-mood (reinforcement)-huh. <br>So it does seem (it) wasn&#8217;t trying to get eaten, huh. <br><br>Broken down, we have [\u98df\u3079] as the verb root, [\u3089\u308c] a voice marker indicating the passive voice, [\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3057] indicating volition, [\u3066\u3044] indicating aspect, [\u306a\u304b\u3063] indicating negation, [\u305f] indicating tense, and [\u3089\u3057\u3044] indicates mood. It is arguably the case that [\u3093\u3060]&#8217;s place in the predicate allows for it to function as a mood indicator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its nominalization effect on the conjugation chain is manifested by the copula portion in both its scope and mood marking renditions, but there are unique restrictions to the mood marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060 not found with the scope marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060. That being said, keep the following points in mind when handling variations of the mood marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Because the mood marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060 reflects the attitude of the speaker, minute differences and restrictions can arise from whether it is contracted or in a different speech register; meaning, \uff5e\u306e\u3060\u30fb\u3093\u3060 vs \uff5e\u306e\u3067\u3059\u30fb\u3093\u3067\u3059 will be a matter of contingency this time.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>As for whether \u3060 is changed to dialectal variants such as \u3058\u3083\u30fb\u3084, those will be treated as being synonymous.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Unlike the scope marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060, tense as well as affirmation vs. negation may interact differently depending on how the mood marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060 functions. Meaning, whether those conjugations make sense is entirely dependent on whether those concepts are compatible on a nuance-by-nuance basis.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Comparing The Two \uff5e\u306e\u3060: <br>Basic Grammar <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main goal of this lesson will be determining the fundamental essence of the mood marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060, which considering how many specific nuances were mentioned, will be an arduous task. <br><br>So far in this lesson, the one commonality that links the mood marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060 with the scope marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060 is that they are etymologically the same, and both possess the same conjugations, but the functionality of the mood marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060 goes beyond making predicates behave more like noun-predicates. <br><br>Providing an &#8220;explanation&#8221; within context is the one-statement description for the overall template to using the mood marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060. The most typical examples do, in fact, behave like this. First, consider the following.<br><br>1. \u30bb\u30b9\u541b\uff1f\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3088\u3002\u51fa\u5f35\u306b\u884c\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3060\u3002<br>Seth-kun? He&#8217;s not here. He went on a business trip. <br><br>The mood marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060 in Ex. 1 serves to demonstrate to the listener that [\u51fa\u5f35\u306b\u884c\u3063\u305f] is the situation behind [\uff08\u30bb\u30b9\u541b\u304c\uff09\u3044\u306a\u3044]. <br><br>Already, we see a subtle yet clear difference in function between the mood and scope functions of \uff5e\u306e\u3060. Instead of defining a Y<sup data-fn=\"7d50a3c9-3f81-48bc-a86b-387ae31d61b0\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#7d50a3c9-3f81-48bc-a86b-387ae31d61b0\" id=\"7d50a3c9-3f81-48bc-a86b-387ae31d61b0-link\">1<\/a><\/sup>, which is at the foundation of the scope marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060, the mood marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060 seems to relate its comment to the context at large. <br><br>Incidentally, we also see a major difference in particle usage within the dependent clauses made by these two different \uff5e\u306e\u3060 regarding \u306f vs \u304c. In the case of the scope marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060, \u306f must never be used, but this restriction does not exist for the mood marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060. This does not mean that \u306f does not occur with the former. Rather, \u306f cannot exist within the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">confines of Y<\/span> in the sentence pattern X\u306f\uff39\u3060 as this pertains to the scope marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following examples, to make identification easier, X for the main clause, if present, will be put in \u3010\u3011and \u304c\u30fb\u306f inside dependent clauses will be greyed.

That is not to say that the scope marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060 is incompatible with these predicate types, as Ex. 5 is an example of it, but there is no such hurdle as demonstrated by Ex. 6. <br><br>5. \u4f55\u3082\u3057\u306a\u3044\u306e\u304c<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u4f11\u61a9<\/span>\u306a\u306e\u3060\u3002<br>Doing nothing is what is defined as a break.<br><br>6. \u3044\u307e<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u4f11\u61a9<\/span>\u306a\u3093\u3060\u3088\uff01<br>I&#8217;m on break right now!<br><br>7. \u30e1\u30fc\u30eb\u78ba\u8a8d\u306f\u4f11\u61a9\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\u4ed5\u4e8b\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3002\u25b3<br>Intended: Checking e-mails is not breaktime; it&#8217;s work. ?<br><br>Commonalities between both types of \uff5e\u306e\u3060 can, though, be found in their shared use of the nominalizer \u306e.

Ah, it&#8217;s snowing!<br>13b. Ah, so it is snowing!<br><br>13a is a reflection of the speaker going outside and simply commenting on their discovery of it snowing. Meanwhile, 13b. recognizes the snowing as something that has been a thing, although they personally are just realizing this. While &#8220;snowing&#8221; is perceptualized as an &#8220;established situation,&#8221; it is not the case that there was any previous context that would have definitively indicated &#8220;snowing&#8221; as being established fact. This is important to keep in mind, because it throws a wrench in the notion that mood \uff5e\u306e\u3060 simply associates a statement with prior context for some explanatory purpose. As such, we can view statements like 13b. as cluing us in to more so the speaker&#8217;s state of mind than anything. In this case, 13b. matches with the &#8220;exclamatory sense of discovery = \u767a\u898b&#8221; nuance mentioned in the chart at the start of the lesson. <br><br>To account for all the nuances mood marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060 has, two factors must be kept in mind. Insofar, these factors will be applied only to declarative sentences (\u5e73\u53d9\u6587).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Whether or not mood \uff5e\u306e\u3060 relates its statement to previous context. This can be viewed as the &#8220;why&#8221; behind mood \uff5e\u306e\u3060, and as we shall see, it is <em>why<\/em> \uff5e\u306e\u3060, as a whole, is understandably viewed as playing an &#8220;explanatory&#8221; role, even with statements in which the previous context is not pertinent to the remark made with mood \uff5e\u306e\u3060. <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Whether mood \uff5e\u306e\u3060 presents a matter to someone else (interpersonal) or is instead directing attention to the situation itself with no intended listener (situation-oriented). This can be viewed as the &#8220;how&#8221; behind mood \uff5e\u306e\u3060.

In isolation, non-interpersonal and interpersonal instances will often appear identical. Tonality alone may, though, be enough to delineate between non-interpersonal and interpersonal nuances most of the time. Even so, how the previous sentences or the situation in which the speaker finds themselves in matter at all would be left to speculation\u2014speculation which Japanese discourse arguably necessitates. In other words, the &#8220;why&#8221; and &#8220;how&#8221; aspects of mood \uff5e\u306e\u3060 are both being considered with what little or no context is being provided. <br><br>With all this being said, consider the following without context, and most importantly, without English translations, but with the likely nuances intended left in Japanese as hints. <br><br>18a. \u3053\u306e\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u62bc\u3059\u3093\u3060\u3002\uff08\u78ba\u8a8d\u30fb\u767a\u898b\u30fb\u5f37\u8abf\u30fb\u63db\u8a00\uff1f\uff09<br><br>18b. \u3053\u306e\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u62bc\u3059\u3093\u3060\uff01\uff08\u6c7a\u610f\u30fb\u547d\u4ee4\uff09<br><br>18c. \u3053\u306e\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u62bc\u3059\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3002\uff08\u6c7a\u610f\uff09<br><br>18d. \u3053\u306e\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u62bc\u3059\u3093\u3067\u3059\uff01\uff08\u6c7a\u610f\u30fb\u547d\u4ee4\uff09<br><br>Simplicity is only as simple as the context allows it to be, but that is where native-like intuition for deciphering even not-so contextualized contexts begins. In all four context-less scenarios, nuances <em>are<\/em> ruled out, which is a major takeaway. <br><br>Although 18a seems to have an array of interpretations, one can still surmise that the speaker is collecting their take on a matter with mood \uff5e\u306e\u3060, and the exact purpose (the &#8220;why&#8221;) would be made clear with preceding context or other outstanding factors, such as whether or not the speaker is alone, whether or not the speaker is talking (directly) to someone, or whether or not anything else had even been said. All these factors would be given facts pertaining to the discourse at hand and readably analyzed by the speaker <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">and<\/span> potential listeners. <br><br>Now let&#8217;s add minimal context. In doing so, we will see that not only does the nuancing of mood \uff5e\u306e\u3060 become clear, if not outright obvious, but that that also necessitates that other nuances of mood \uff5e\u306e\u3060 could highly unnatural, if not ungrammatical at worst as a result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>18e. \u305d\u3046\u304b\u3001\u3053\u306e\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u62bc\u3059\u3093\u3060\u3002<br>i. Oh, thus (X) flipping this switch. (\u518d\u8a8d\u8b58)<br>ii. Oh, you flip this switch. (\u767a\u898b) <br>iii. Oh, which is why you flip this switch. (\u78ba\u8a8d)<br>iv. Oh, so flip this switch. (\u547d\u4ee4) X<br>v. Oh, you flip this switch (, so you know). (\u6559\u793a ??\u30fb\u544a\u767d ?? \u30fb\u5f37\u8abf ???) <br><br>Interpretations i-iii are all instances of non-interpersonal \uff5e\u306e\u3060, and while it may be vexing to be still left with multiple interpretations, external factors would otherwise assist. For instance, with i., knowing who the agent (=doer) is would tremendously help in knowing why the speaker is acknowledging flipping the switch has some importance in the overall scheme of things. As for ii., potential scenarios for how self-discovery on what happens when a certain switch is flipped comes into play are easy to imagine. Perhaps you are in a dungeon course, and you have been wondering how to get to the next room. You suddenly come across a panel and surmise that pressing the one with an ON\/OFF switch will unlock some nearby passageway. iii. is more or less the same as i., but the epiphany is being attributed to outsider information. Someone else is present, but the actual statement is not being directed back at the listener to impose one&#8217;s own recognition of the matter to the entity that made it possible. Such a bizarre turning of the tables on what ought to be merely recognition of some greater importance on the part of oneself is precisely why v. is unnatural (but not entirely inconceivable). For instance, say \u305d\u3046\u304b were not being used to acknowledge a previous statement but were more so indicative of a spur of the moment need to indicate that the statement marked by \uff5e\u306e\u3060 is what the listener ought to hear &#8211; not to be confused with a lightbulb moment. In that scenario, what the speaker comes up with themselves could be pushed onto the listener as to what is the case or should happen, but the execution would still be unnatural, as all usages of \uff5e\u306e\u3060 imply a certain level of conviction reflecting the speaker&#8217;s affirmation. Likewise, making an outright command (iv) in this manner remains ungrammatical, as commands made with mood \uff5e\u306e\u3060, while always interpersonal, do not occur out of the blue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To visualize these two factors\u2014interpersonal (\u5bfe\u4eba\u7684) and situation-oriented (\u5bfe\u4e8b\u7684)\u2014of mood \uff5e\u306e\u3060, the following chart illustrates them with directionality at the forefront. Rather than viewing them as opposing meanings, they are juxtaposed in a way that highlights how they relate to each other. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"458\" data-attachment-id=\"10286\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/imabi.org\/the-mood-marker-%ef%bd%9e%e3%81%ae%e3%81%a0\/image-4\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/image.png?fit=1893%2C963&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1893,963\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/image.png?fit=300%2C153&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/image.png?fit=900%2C458&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/image.png?resize=900%2C458&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10286\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/image.png?resize=1024%2C521&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/image.png?resize=300%2C153&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/image.png?resize=768%2C391&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/image.png?resize=1536%2C781&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/image.png?resize=1200%2C610&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/image.png?w=1893&amp;ssl=1 1893w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/imabi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/02\/image.png?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In a way, interpersonal \uff5e\u306e\u3060 is like superimposing a thought bubble regarding a matter onto the listener, with the presumption that the listener does not know along with the assertion that the situation ought to be known or potentially dealt with (by the speaker and\/or listener). <br><br>Incidentally, this presentation on the part of interpersonal \uff5e\u306e\u3060 is not the same as merely presenting a fact the speakers knows that the listener happens to not know.

Going back to how the basic sentence structure is still X\u306fY\u3060, in this light, [X=P] and [Y\uff0b\u306e\u3060 = Q],  and with X not present within the sentence, P and Q must be related. <br><br>To explain situations when P seems to not be present at all, P can be akin to the background situation. When the background is missing, the situation (Q) remains, and that recognition of Q, in a way, admitting that Q is there is like saying Q\u2248P.<br><br>When P is absent like in Exs. 30-31, indeed, there are still looming circumstances prompting the speaker to make these recognitions.

Perhaps, even, talk had been had that the speaker is privy to, which further prompted this command. In which case, the distinction between P<sub>v<\/sub> and P<sub>nv<\/sub> would be purely circumstantial to the point of being trivial. If so, we would imagine that there would be contexts in which delineating [Q=P] and [Q\u2260P] is difficult on face value, and lo behold, such contexts are quite common.<br><br>32a. \u672c\u3001\u305f\u304f\u3055\u3093\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u308b\u3093\u3060\uff08\u306a\u3042\uff09\u3002<br>32b. \u672c\u3001\u305f\u304f\u3055\u3093\u6301\u3063\u3066\u308b\u3093\u3060\uff08\u306a\u3042\uff09\u3002<br>32c. \u672c\u68da\u304c\uff17\u3064\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3093\u3060\uff08\u306a\u3042\uff09\u3002<br>32a.

Huh, (he) has <em>seven<\/em> bookshelves. <br><br>As context, imagine the speaker of Ex. 32 visiting Seth-sensei&#8217;s library. The room has seven bookshelves with many books, and these are 3 possible comments the speaker could make, all of which are situation-oriented and examples of talking to oneself. <br><br>Books are meant to be read. Walking in and seeing bookshelves with lots of books, knowing that one is visiting Seth-sensei&#8217;s library and how he must read for his profession, conversations that may have been had prior, etc. all constitute as P<sub>v<\/sub>, with P<sub>nv<\/sub> as an extra bonus upon seeing the library for oneself\u2014thus also explaining why the speaker readily understands Q. Meanwhile, 32c feels more like just a response toward the visual information (P<sub>nv<\/sub>). Now, as for recognizing &#8220;Seth-sensei having a lot of books&#8221; as Q like in 32b, whether P<sub>v<\/sub> is involved is up in the air. The speaker presumably knows they are about to go to a library, but perhaps nothing about the library has ever been ascertained until entering its doors. With either scenario being equally plausible, and with 32c being just as valid as a response as 32a or 32c, where the speaker gets P may very well affect what the speaker ultimately states is Q; however, if P=Q, and if situations (Qs) can be multi-faceted, then this really is just nitpicking at P(<sub>n<\/sub>)<sup data-fn=\"7f26f7fd-8d9f-4ecc-a3b6-07b49f572ed7\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#7f26f7fd-8d9f-4ecc-a3b6-07b49f572ed7\" id=\"7f26f7fd-8d9f-4ecc-a3b6-07b49f572ed7-link\">3<\/a><\/sup>, with <sub>n<\/sub> standing for tackling what Q is from all possible angles. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u95a2\u9023\u4ed8\u3051 \u2248 \u8aac\u660e \u2248 \u539f\u56e0?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of \u95a2\u9023\u4ed8\u3051 (association) to describe how mood \uff5e\u306e\u3060 pertains to P, putting aside what P is, as opposed to \u8aac\u660e (explanation), or \u539f\u56e0 (cause)\/\u7406\u7531 reason, is for good reason.

In both cases, Statement 1 cannot be substantiated as the cause for Statement 2. In Ex. 34a, the speaker stops talking because they notice how she is reacting. In Ex. 34b, &#8220;she&#8221; behaved that way, and the context for that is that the speaker stopped talking. In Ex. 36a, the speaker being injured is still being associated with falling down the stairs, but the association is not &#8220;falling down the stairs causing the injury&#8221;; instead, just like in English, it is unclear how or when the speaker got hurt as well as how falling down the stairs is involved with that assertion. People can still be unscathed from falling down stairs. A previous injury could have been a factor in falling down the stairs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s relate mood \uff5e\u306e\u3060 back to &#8220;X\u306fY\u3060&#8221; once more, but in the context of nominal predicates &#8211; given how nominal predicates state how the predicate equates to X. \u5bfa\u6751 (1984) points out that, principally, with mood \uff5e\u306e\u3060, P\u306fY\u3060 is no different than X\u306fY\u3060. To demonstrate this, the following examples were raised:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>40.  \u3042\u306e\u97f3\u306f\u4f55\u3060\uff1f<br>Response A: \u3042\u308c\u306f\u9ce9\u304c\u9cf4\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u58f0\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>Response B: \u3042\u308c\u306f\u9ce9\u304c\u9cf4\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3002<br><br>41.

As for Ex. 41, this &#8220;what&#8221; (Y) that the detective wants to be identified by means of X is presented in a very simple format, and the same can be said of Responses A and B. However, while Responses C and D may seem simple, C does not truly answer the question as it pertains to the investigation, and D seemingly self-incriminates the suspect. <br><br>Insofar, we can surmise that [X=P] and [P\u2248Q], but that [P = reason, Q = result] is ungrammatical. Otherwise, the association denoted by mood \uff5e\u306e\u3060 would have to that of cause-and-effect, which is not substantiated by Exs. 33-39, but Ex. 36 also taught us that P and Q cannot just be juxtaposed to be understood. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given all this, how exactly is X\u306fY\u3060 any different than P\u306fY\u306e\u3060? One might argue that, for all intended purposes, grammatical limitations on the former necessitate the latter, and that the resultant sentence very much looks and acts like the former. This would explain why Responses A and B are so parallel in Exs. 40-41, but as far as how \uff5e\u306e\u3060 ought to be defined, perhaps the answer is as simple as P (context) being defined as Q, in a parallel structure with its own flexibility. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, as much as one might want X to stand for anything, nouns cannot stand for anything. Context at large, though, can stand for anything. When we wish to define that context, the inability of X to fulfill that role triggers the transformation of this basic sentence structure to P\u306fQ\u306e\u3060. <br><br>Something we shall see in great detail in our third lesson on \uff5e\u306e\u3060, this triggering can even be combined together via dependent clauses as such:<br><br>42.

This may make you think, &#8220;well, what about nominalization? Is that not what \uff5e\u306e\u3060 does to a Y?&#8221; That is precisely what happens, but it is crucial to note that nominalization is a transformative process. To see this in action, look no further than \uff5e\u306e\u3060 predicates involving origin.

In this case X[\uff5e\u306e] still gets transformed into a P that is then associated with a Q via \uff5e\u306e\u3060.
