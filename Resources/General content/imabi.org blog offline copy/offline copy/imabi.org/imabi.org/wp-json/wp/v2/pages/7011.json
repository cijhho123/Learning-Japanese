Though part of Standard Japanese, it is also indicative of Eastern Japanese dialects, which includes not only Tokyo Dialect but also dialects spoken further north. Outside those areas, the use of this final particle is not so common, so if you are studying abroad in Osaka or elsewhere further out from the capital region (\u9996\u90fd\u570f), your exposure may be limited to literature, social media, and TV.<br><br>This lesson will tackle all there is to know about \u3055 from three separate angles: how \u3055 is practically used, grammatical restrictions that define when it can and cannot be used, as well as dialectal variation. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Use \u3055<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary purpose of the final particle \u3055 is to draw the listener into what the speaker has to say, and the statement by the speaker itself usually carries a friendly tone. In a sense, the speaker is <em>checking themselves as much as they are letting the listener in on the situation.<\/em> The statement may even be a retort (\u53cd\u99c1) which hints at wanting the listener to rethink. <br><br>1. \u300c\u30c6\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u541b\u3001\u30de\u30b8\u9045\u3044\u306a\u3042\u3002\u300d\u300c\u3042\u3044\u3064\u306a\u3089\u3001\u305d\u306e\u3046\u3061\u6765\u308b\u3055\u3002\u300d<br>&#8220;Man, Taylor-kun sure is late, huh.&#8221; &#8220;Knowing him, he&#8217;ll show up sooner or later.&#8221;<br><br>2. \u50d5\u306b\u3060\u3063\u3066\u3084\u308c\u308b\u3055\u3002<br>That&#8217;s something even I can do!<br><br>3. \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u308b\u3055\uff01\u304d\u306e\u3046\u898b\u305f\u3082\u3093\u3067\uff08\u3055\uff09\uff01<br>&#8216;Course I know!

In Ex. 6, \u3055 is ungrammatical for several reasons. The speaker is clearly not reinforcing a thought in their mind, the statement is not a retort in any way, and it is not that the case that the speaker made the statement to draw the listener in, which would imply that the listener was interested to begin with. Rather, the statement is ultimately concluded with a suggestion, which as we will see later, is also not grammatical with \u3055.<br><br>6. \u3042\u305d\u3053\u306e\u5e2d\u306f\u7a7a\u3044\u3066\u308b\uff5b\u3088 \u3007\u30fb\u3055 X\uff5d\u3002\u3042\u305d\u3053\u306b\u5ea7\u3063\u305f\u3089\u3069\u3046\uff1f<br>That seat over there is open.

There is a general rule of thumb that one must not overuse any particular final particle, as it is never the case that your mood or the points you are making are inherently always the same. In the case of \u3055, though, when it does appear in a sentence, especially longer sentences indicative of conversation, once it shows up once, it may appear in several locations in that same sentence.<br><br>11. \u3044\u3044\u3055\u3001\u3044\u3044\u3055\u3001\u5f7c\u5973\u306f\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u304c\u9ad8\u3059\u304e\u3066\u4ed6\u4eba\u3092\u898b\u4e0b\u308d\u3059\u304f\u305b\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304b\u3089\u3055\u3042\u3001\u5c11\u3057\u3070\u3063\u304b\u75db\u3044\u76ee\u306b\u906d\u3063\u305f\u307b\u3046\u304c\u3088\u3063\u307d\u3069\u826f\u3044\u3060\u308d\u3046\u3002<br>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; about; since she&#8217;s so prideful and tends to look down on others, it&#8217;s probably all the better that she experiences a hardship a bit. <br><br>12. \u3068\u3044\u3046\u304b\u3055\u3042\u3001\u305d\u3053\u307e\u3067\u6df1\u304f\u8003\u3048\u8fbc\u307e\u306a\u3044\u3067\uff08\u3055\u3042 \u25b3<sup data-fn=\"8589ac4b-9b5c-4a20-bc77-06f548d86c9a\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#8589ac4b-9b5c-4a20-bc77-06f548d86c9a\" id=\"8589ac4b-9b5c-4a20-bc77-06f548d86c9a-link\">1<\/a><\/sup>\uff09\u3002<br>I mean, don&#8217;t be overthinking it that far. <br><br>Often in a more literary, sanctimonious, and\/or offhand tone with an effect similar to that of \uff5e\uff08\u3093\uff09\u3060\u3088<sup data-fn=\"1d9758be-7624-4e78-a741-bad4ab072e14\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#1d9758be-7624-4e78-a741-bad4ab072e14\" id=\"1d9758be-7624-4e78-a741-bad4ab072e14-link\">2<\/a><\/sup>, \u3055 may create a lighthearted emphasis on some situation. <br><br>13. \u305f\u3044\u3057\u305f\u3053\u3068\u306a\u3044\u3055\uff01<br>It ain&#8217;t a big deal!<br><br>14. \u3053\u306e\u4e16\u306e\u7f8e\u3057\u3055\u306f\u5168\u3066 \u5185\u306b\u60b2\u3057\u307f\u3092\u79d8\u3081\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3055<br>All the beauty in this world conceals sadness within, you see.<br>From \u300e\u8679\u300fby Aqua Timez.<br><br>15. \u672c\u4eba\u306f\u9000\u6821\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\u3063\u3066\u3001\u305d\u308c\u3092\u4e00\u756a\u5fc3\u914d\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3055\u3002<br>He&#8217;s scared silly of being expelled from school; that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s worrying about the most. <br>From \u300e\u543e\u8f29\u306f\u732b\u3067\u3042\u308b\u300fby \u590f\u76ee\u6f31\u77f3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>16.\u300c\u541b\u3082\u59bb\u541b\u96e3\u3060\u308d\u3046\u3068\u4e91\u3046\u306e\u3055\u300d<br>&#8220;I&#8217;m asking if you, too, are dealing with a troublesome wife.&#8221; <br>From \u300e\u543e\u8f29\u306f\u732b\u3067\u3042\u308b\u300fby \u590f\u76ee\u6f31\u77f3.<br><br>17.\u300c\u9032\u884c\u3055\u305b\u305f\u3044\u306e\u306f\u5c71\u3005\u3060\u304c\u3001\u3069\u3046\u3057\u3066\u3082\u65e5\u304c\u66ae\u308c\u3066\u304f\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3060\u304b\u3089\u56f0\u308b\u306e\u3055\u300d<br>Much as I&#8217;d like to speed it up, that laggard sun won&#8217;t set; its hang-up is most hard to bear.&#8221; <br>From \u300e\u543e\u8f29\u306f\u732b\u3067\u3042\u308b\u300fby \u590f\u76ee\u6f31\u77f3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some regions of Japan such as Okinawa, this can be more extensively heard in the spoken language than is typical in the rest of the country.
