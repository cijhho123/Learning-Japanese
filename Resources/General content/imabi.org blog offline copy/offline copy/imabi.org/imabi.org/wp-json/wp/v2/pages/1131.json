Although we are aware of how it follows other conjunctive particles such as \u306a\u304c\u3089 and \u3064\u3064 to act as an intensifier, it too can follow verbs to function as a conjunction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u9023\u4f53\u5f62 \uff0b \u3082<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the early Meiji Period, the particle \u3082 has been able to follow the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 of a verb to show one of two potential relations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>&#8220;Even under X circumstance, Y is still the case.&#8221; Synonymous with \uff5e\u3066\u3082.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;Even though X is so, Y is not the case. Synonymous with \uff5e\u3051\u308c\u3069.<br><br>The main reason&nbsp;for why \u9023\u4f53\u5f62\uff0b\u3082 came about is that has served as a fancy sounding short hand for the grammar points it is synonymous with. In&nbsp;first situation, it could stand for either \uff5e\u3066\u3082 or the somewhat more emphatic \uff5e\u3068\u3082 without having to sound emotional in tone. In the second interpretation, it majorly simplified conjugation rules at the time before \uff5e\u3051\u308c\u3069 ultimately replaced the particle \u3069.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Old examples of this grammar point shows how it was once capable of following the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 of various past tense markers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1a. \u671f\u9650\u306f\u4eca\u65e5\u306b\u8feb\u308a\u305f\u308b\u3082\u3001\u6e96\u5099\u306f\u307e\u3060\u6210\u3089\u305a\u3002\u3007<br>1b. \u671f\u9650\u306f\u4eca\u65e5\u306b\u8feb\u308a\u305f\u308c\u3069\u3082\u3001\u6e96\u5099\u306f\u307e\u3060\u6210\u3089\u305a\u3002\u25ce<br>Even though the deadline has finally made it to today, preparations have yet to be made.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2a. \u7d4c\u904e\u306f\u9817\u308b\u826f\u597d\u306a\u308a\u3057\u3082\u3001\u6628\u65e5\u3088\u308a\u804a\u304b\u75b2\u52b4\u306e\u72b6\u3042\u308a\u3002\u3007<br>2b. \u7d4c\u904e\u306f\u9817\u308b\u826f\u597d\u306a\u308a\u3057\u304b\u3069\u3082\u3001\u6628\u65e5\u3088\u308a\u804a\u304b\u75b2\u52b4\u306e\u72b6\u3042\u308a\u3002\u25ce<br>Although results were extremely favorable, conditions have been&nbsp;rather more tiring than yesterday.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t until the early 1900s that this grammatical shorthand became accepted, but as formal publications became more frequently written in a way more aligned with the spoken language, \u3082 only found itself after the non-past tense of verbs. This is because that it may correlate to either the non-past or the past tense, with the overall tense of the sentence being made clear at the end. In a way, \u3082 attaches lazily to the verb without connecting itself to a proper conjunctive particle because it has become outfitted with that purpose.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, this grammar is incredibly common in news headlines and any other similar form of abbreviated speech.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.
