Whereas the final particle \u304b indicates a question, the final particle \u3088 highlights a statement in the same way &#8220;!&#8221; functions in English. These emotion markers are colloquially known in Japanese as \u8a9e\u5c3e, the name stemming from how they are tagged at the end of phrases. <br><br>In this lesson, we will learn about the two most fundamental emotion-marking final particles in Japanese: \u3088 and \u306d. At their most basic understanding, \u3088 emphasizes emotion, judgment, or assertion, and&nbsp;\u306d seeks agreement and\/or a response from the addressee(s).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Final Particle \u3088<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The final particle \u3088, as will be touched on more at the conclusion of this lesson, derives from its original use of calling out someone to action.<br><br>1. \u65e5\u672c\u3088\u3001\u9811\u5f35\u308c\uff01<br>Japan!

In everyday use, it is known for highlighting something you wish to make absolutely clear to the listener.<br><br>2. \u304d\u3087\u3046\u6771\u4eac\u306b\u884c\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3088\u3002<br>I&#8217;m going to Tokyo today. <br><br>3. \u30bb\u30b9\u3055\u3093\u306f\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u3067\u3059\u3088\u3002<br>Seth-san is American.<br><br>4<ruby>. <\/ruby>\u5f7c\u6c0f\u306b<ruby>\u4f1a<\/ruby>\u3044\u305f\u3044\u3088\u3002\u2197<br>I want to see my boyfriend!<br><br>While this function may seem relatively benign, learners are tempted to overuse it in situations that may sound rude, especially to superiors, when stating a fact\/desire is such an authoritative manner is not conducive to overall Japanese etiquette. <br><br>5. \u306f\u3044\u3001\u308f\u304b\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3088\u3002<br>Yes, I know. <br><br>6. \u79c1\u304c\u3084\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3088\u3002<br><em>I<\/em> will do it. <br><br>Of these two examples, Ex. 5 is just as problematic in English just as much as it is in Japanese in a formal environment. Although Ex. 6 could be interpreted as the speaker stepping up to the plate to do something that others are not, given the wrong tone, it could just as easily be interpreted as complaining or showing frustration. <br><br>For the remainder of this discussion, it is important to distinguish between grammaticality and naturalness. Unless you are not making a declarative statement (\u80af\u5b9a\u6587), using \u3088 would not be ungrammatical no matter how much you use it; however, your discourse will sound quite unnatural to the Japanese ears. Nonetheless, the scenarios discussed in this lesson pertaining to its naturalness will be as objective as possible. <br><br>For instance, if you are telling something to someone that is beneficial to that person, the use of \u3088 is natural so long as the speaker&#8217;s tone is cordial. In fact, the lack of \u3088 from the following examples would make the statements sound as if the speaker has no concern of the listener&#8217;s condition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. \u304a\u305b\u3093\u3079\u3044\u3001\u3069\u3046\u305e\u3002\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3088\u3002<br>Here are some rice crackers.

The lack of \u3088 in such situations would cause the speaker to sound emotionless. <br><br>9. \u3055\u3042\u3001\u59cb\u3081\u307e\u3059\u3088\u3002<br>Alright, (I\/we)&#8217;ll be starting. <br><br>Speaking of sounding emotionless, the same goes for how one would naturally respond to a cordial, friendly question. Affirmation is often accompanied with \u3088 to add a cheery tone to one&#8217;s response. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10. \u300c<ruby>\u6388\u696d<rt>\u3058\u3085\u304e\u3087\u3046<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3001\u7d42\u308f\u3063\u305f\uff1f\u300d\u300c\u3046\u3093\u3001\u7d42\u308f\u3063\u305f\u3088\u300d<br>&#8220;Is your class over?&#8221; &#8220;Yep, it is.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Intonation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When the use of \u3088 is meant to solicit a response from the listener, it is accompanied with a sentence-wide slight rise in intonation (\u2197).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11.&nbsp;<ruby>\u9aea<rt>\u304b\u307f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306b\u4f55\u304b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u307e\u3059\u3088\u3002\u3000\u2197<br>Something&#8217;s stuck in your hair.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12. \u305d\u308c\u3001<ruby>\u8d85<rt>\u3061\u3087\u3046<\/rt>\u8f9b<rt>\u304b\u3089<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3044\u3088\u3002\u3000\u2197\u3000<br>That&#8217;s gonna be hot (spicy).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving new information in this way implies that the listener does not already know.
