This will help us tackle how modality works, as it is important to understand that &#8220;modality&#8221; comes about in as many ways as it is possible to process the world around us. That being said, we will need to keep the following modal dynamics in mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Assertive\/Declarative Modality: Pertains to the truth\/falseness of a statement.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Interrogative Modality (Uncertainty): Questioning an assertion\/declaration.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Situation-Oriented Modality (\u306e\u3060): Grasping situation at hand as pertinent in the greater context, whether that context has been established prior or the speaker is recognizing said connection in real time. <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Interpersonal Modality (\u306e\u3060): Presenting situation at hand as pertinent in the greater context to a listener, whether that context has been established prior the speaker is recognizing said connection in real time and feels that the listener ought to know.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We will first tackle these structures within two environments: when only Situation A is present and when two(+) situations are present.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A + \uff5e\uff08\u306a\uff09\u306e\u3060\u304b<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas \uff5e\u306e\u304b is not restricted to sentence-medial position, \uff5e\u306e\u3060\u304b very much is restricted to sentence-medial position, even if it does not immediately look like it. <br><br>8. \u4f55\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u308b\u3093\u3060\u304b\u3002<br>What the heck are you saying, (because whatever it is you&#8217;re trying to say, I can&#8217;t figure it out). <br><br>In situations in which it appears \uff5e\u306e\u3060\u304b, or \uff5e\u3060\u304b for that matter, is in sentence-final position, ellipsis of the predicate that would otherwise follow\u2014typically on the lines of \u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u30fb\u5206\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044\u2014is undoubtedly to blame. In Exs. 9-10, we see sentences in which such predicates do occur. Then, there are many instances in which \uff5e\u3093\u3060\u304b ends a dependent clause with an implicit &#8220;don&#8217;t know&#8221; built in like in Exs. 12-14.<br><br>9. \u4f55\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u6771\u4eac\u3078\u51fa\u3066\u6765\u305f\u3093\u3060\u304b\u5206\u304b\u308a\u3083\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>I have not the slightest idea why it is that you&#8217;ve come out to Tokyo.<br><br>10. \u3067\u3082\u3001\u3069\u3046\u3057\u3066\u7c73\u5b50\u3055\u3093\u304c\u6bba\u3055\u308c\u305f\u306e\u3060\u304b\u5206\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044\u308f\u3002\u3042\u3093\u305f\u3001\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u308b\u3067\u3057\u3087\uff1f<br>But, I just don&#8217;t understand why Yoneko-san was killed.

This &#8220;downright dismissal,&#8221; though, is also nuanced, as we are dealing with the mood marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060. That being said, the purpose for why exactly \u306e\u3060 is used will be contextually dependent. Given that \uff5e\u306e\u3060\u304b pertains to uncertainty on the part of the speaker, however, we can largely narrow our focus to the situation-oriented mood marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060. When the interpersonal mood \uff5e\u306e\u3060 is at play, though, we get sentences like Ex. 11 which pushes the speaker&#8217;s downright dismissal onto the listener as a given. <br><br>11. \u3069\u3053\u306e\u4eba\u304c\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3060\u304b\u77e5\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3092\u8cb7\u3046\u3084\u3064\u306f\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>No one is going to buy something if they don&#8217;t know who the heck made it.<br><br>Now, as for the situation-oriented mood marker \uff5e\u306e\u3060, it is used to verbalize a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">recognition<\/span> on the part of the speaker that the situation at hand ties to some context at large, placing \u304b after it puts all that reasoning into question, and it is that connection which the speaker is downright dismissing. However, this is not necessarily the same as denying that the state\/action of Situation A is taking place.

Decide already.<br><br>While that is how Ex. 20a-d would all translate to, let&#8217;s step back and think of how these diction options differ from each other. In doing so, we will be directly referring to P (previous context) and Q (situation at hand), which you may recall from our study of the mood marker \u306e\u3060.<br><br>Starting with Ex. 20d., A and B are conjoined with \u304b. Here, there is no uncertainty implied between the two. As such, modality is restricted to [\u3069\u3063\u3061\u306a\u3093\u3060], in which case whatever Y in &#8220;X is Y&#8221; ends up being, that is a defining choice to be made for the scenario at hand. <br><br>As for Ex. 20c., let&#8217;s say that the pivotal role of said choice between X and Y is already known, and with that previous context (P) at the forefront of both the speaker&#8217;s mind and, presumably, the listener&#8217;s mind, the choice between [\u3053\u308c] and [\u3042\u308c] truly does feel like a coin toss, one that the speaker really wants the agent=listener to make. <br><br>As for Ex. 20b., we strip the sentence of the modality behind [\u3053\u308c] and [\u3042\u308c], but we know that the presence of \u3060\u304b indicates very high uncertainty. That uncertainty, then, must be directed toward [\u3053\u308c] and [\u3042\u308c] even being what X and Y are. Thus, on a syntactic level, it is closer to d., with the core difference being that the speaker sounds far more frustrated that the agent has little clue as to which way is up. This is ultimately rooted in how the speaker is choosing to raise these factors as scenarios=predicates as opposed to a choice between two things.<br><br>Last but not least, Ex. 20a. expresses zero confidence on the part of the speaker that the agent=listener knows which way is up; nonetheless, that defining of the previous context (P) is still pivotal to their situation. Even so, while A and B are being mentioned, they have already been ruled out by the speaker as being Q (the situation pertaining to P). In this light, we see how d. is closer in meaning and function to c., with the difference being the sheer lack of faith that the agent is going to bring about a resolution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>21. \u7f8e\u8ac7\u306a\u3093\u3060\u304b\u3069\u3046\u3060\u304b\u3001\u5909\u306a\u567a\u306a\u3093\u3060\u3002<br>Whether this is supposed to be some moving tale or what have you, (I don&#8217;t know), but it&#8217;s a strange tale at that. <br><br>In this example, we see how the \uff5e\u306a\u3093\u3060\u304b indicates zero faith on the part of the speaker that the \u567a is of \u7f8e\u8ac7 quality, but then Situation B that could possibly describe it is rendered as \u3069\u3046 as a placeholder of sorts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\uff5e\u3060\u304b\uff08\u308f\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044\u30fb\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\uff09<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The defining difference between \uff5e\u3060\u304b and \uff5e\u304b is that \uff5e\u3060\u304b is used with predicates, situations which the speaker is already more or less refuting as being the case, whereas \uff5e\u304b merely states option(s).

This is not to be confused when \uff5e\u3060\u304b denotes an embedded question, in which case the affirmative modality of \u3060 is not dampened by the inquisitive (\u2248uncertain) modality of \u304b.\",\"id\":\"90852bd0-b1ec-43ba-9926-1647d362fc8e\"},{\"content\":\"The same could be said for when {\uff5e\u3060\u304b\uff5e\u3060\u304b} strings connect nouns and are then capable of taking case particles. While the use of \uff5e\u3060\u304b with an inferable \u308f\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044\u30fb\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044 or similar predicate is fairly common, its use as a conjunctive particle outright in this fashion is fairly uncommon and can be viewed as being dialectal despite appearing in literature.\",\"id\":\"b96cf551-52a9-43d7-9cc7-78d9fa74998f\"},{\"content\":\"\uff5e\u3060\u304b has existed in Tokyo speech for centuries, largely mirroring how it is showcased in this discussion. In both antiquity and the modern era, instances in which \u3060 has low modality and is not subsequently ellipsed when combined with \u304b ought to be treated as dialectal.\",\"id\":\"4da6a3f7-e4d7-449d-9d44-99a13942f971\"},{\"content\":\"In contrast, the dialectal copulas \u3084\u30fb\u3058\u3083 are not used in metalinguistic or parenthetical fashion, exhibiting zero compatibility in the surface structure of sentences with \u304b in both sentence-medial and sentence-final positions. What prevents \u3060 from being ellipsed, as we have seen, is modality. If a modal function can squeeze itself in between the [COP=copula] and [question.marker] functions in the chain of agglutination, the copula is spared from ellipsis. This also explains why \u3067\u3042\u308b\u304b and \u3067\u3059\u304b are not problematic whatsoever, as both represent their own moods [formality] and [politeness] respectively.    \",\"id\":\"b648df30-a6f0-4c67-afa9-6bfc0c65212e\"}]"},"tags":[],"class_list":["post-12344","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry"],"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/PeXUlI-3d6","jetpack-related-posts":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/12344","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/158153075"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=12344"}],"version-history":[{"count":18,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/12344\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":12384,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/12344\/revisions\/12384"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=12344"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=12344"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
