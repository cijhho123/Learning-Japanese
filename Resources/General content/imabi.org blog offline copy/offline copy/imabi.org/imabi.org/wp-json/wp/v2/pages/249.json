Intransitive verbs <br>ii. Transitive verbs<br>iii. Transitive verbs which <em>may<\/em> become intransitive with \uff5e\u51fa\u308b<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Verbs in Category i are the easiest to identify, as \uff5e\u51fa\u308b can be alternatively viewed as its independent verb iteration with the particle \u3066 happening to not intervene. The reason for why \u3066 does not intervene is so that the actions of V<sub>1<\/sub> and V<sub>2<\/sub> may occur concurrently as opposed to being separate instances in time. As for why \uff5e\u51fa\u3059 is not grammatical with this category, the reason is that the \uff5e\u51fa\u3059 would be interpreted as an aspect marker (Meaning \u2461 \u2193), but that does not make sense with all verbs, and such verbs are those which entail a progression, which goes against a dynamic, instantaneous start. If, however, a context can be conceived where that problem is alleviated, \uff5e\u51fa\u3059 may become, in said context, grammatical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>29. \u50b7\u8de1\u304b\u3089\u81bf\u304c\u6ef2\u307f\uff5b\u51fa\u3066 \u3007\u30fb\u51fa\u3057\u3066 \u25b3\uff5d\u3044\u308b\u3002<br>Puss is oozing out from the scar.<br><br>30. \u751f\u5f92\u305f\u3061\u306f\u4e00\u6b69\u524d\u3078\u9032\u307f\uff5b\u51fa\u305f \u3007\u30fb\u51fa\u3057\u305f \u25b3\uff5d\u3002<br>The students proceeded one step forward.<br><br>31. \u304a\u5ef6\u306f\u308f\u3056\u3068\u53d6\u308a\u5408\u308f\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\u3068\u4e91\u3063\u3066\u5225\u306b\u7169\u3044\u9854\u3082\u3057\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\u611b\u5b0c\u3092\u898b\u305b\u305f\u5e73\u6c17\u3068\u3067\u3082\u3044\u3046\u3088\u3046\u306a\u614b\u5ea6\u3092\u3068\u3063\u305f\u3002\u5c0f\u6797\u306f\u3082\u3046\u4e00\u6b69\u524d\u3078\u9032\u307f\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>Onobu intentionally paid no mind (to him).

In the case of \uff5e\u51fa\u3059, it not only indicates the start, but it also implies an intense beginning, and a duration which necessities a change in the position of the agent\/subject. <br><br>Because Usage \u2461 is an extension of Usage \u2460 and not the other way around, context as well as understanding how the action of V<sub>1<\/sub> plays out will determine whether \uff5e\u51fa\u3059 implies duration. For instance, with the verb \u601d\u3044\u51fa\u3059 (to remember), the action of &#8220;remembering&#8221; is instantaneous, and the role of \uff5e\u51fa\u3059 is to emphasize how the thoughts put forth were done so view the act of \u601d\u3046. Therefore, generally speaking, \u601d\u3044\u51fa\u3059 is not intended to mean &#8220;to begin to remember,&#8221; and for that meaning we find that \u601d\u3044\u51fa\u3057\u59cb\u3081\u308b is used, which is a great indicator as to how \uff5e\u59cb\u3081\u308b and \uff5e\u51fa\u3059 are not fully interchangeable<sup data-fn=\"f0543a5f-6974-40ea-bf2d-c2f9ac1da55c\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#f0543a5f-6974-40ea-bf2d-c2f9ac1da55c\" id=\"f0543a5f-6974-40ea-bf2d-c2f9ac1da55c-link\">8<\/a><\/sup>. <br><br>Yet, \u601d\u3044\u51fa\u3059 can mean &#8220;to begin to think&#8221; in some contexts, just never &#8220;to begin to remember.&#8221; This is when \uff5e\u51fa\u3059 is meant as Meaning \u2461. To prevent V<sub>1<\/sub> from being interpreted normally as an instantaneous event, it would need to be coupled with something that makes it clear \uff5e\u51fa\u3059 is marking it as the start of an emotionally significant endeavor. <br><br>53. \u30ad\u30e0\u5148\u751f\u306e\u8aac\u660e\u304c\u6b63\u3057\u304f\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3068\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u3057\u3066\u304d\u305f\u3002<br>I began to think that perhaps Kim Sensei&#8217;s explanations were not right. <br><br>Here, we see that the speaker is coming to a serious realization, and the aspect of how that action (V<sub>1<\/sub> = \u601d\u3046) is playing out is actually being marked by two aspect markers: \uff5e\u51fa\u3059 and \uff5e\u3066\u304f\u308b to truly get to how it is coming about over time. <br><br>Next, let&#8217;s consider the verb \u4f5c\u308a\u51fa\u3059.

When \uff5e\u51fa\u3059 is interpreted as Meaning \u2460, V<sub>1<\/sub>&#8216;s action is more often than not fulfilled\/completed upon the object of the sentence having been put forth. In the context of &#8220;to make,&#8221; the point at which the speaker is saying that it has been produced forth, indeed, \uff5e\u51fa\u3059 could not be interpreted as an aspect marker describing duration. Yet, upon further review, context is key, as \u4f5c\u308a\u51fa\u3059 can be used to mean &#8220;to begin making.&#8221; Let&#8217;s compare two sentences, the first in which \u4f5c\u308a\u51fa\u3059 describes &#8220;something &#8220;completed&#8221; versus the second in which it describes something &#8220;starting with an impactful onset.&#8221; <br><br>54. \u4eba\u985e\u306f\u8a00\u8a9e\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>Mankind invented language.<br><br>55. \u5973\u738b\u8702\u304c\u4e00\u5339\u3067\u5de3\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u6642\u70b9\u3067\u5de3\u3092\u898b\u3064\u3051\u305f\u5834\u5408\u306f\u3001\u6bd4\u8f03\u7684\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u99c6\u9664\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002<br>If you discover a nest at the time in which the queen bee has singlehandedly begun to build it, it is relatively easy to exterminate.<br><br>In Ex. 54, we understand from general knowledge that our species has language, but we are also the inventors of that creation.

As for Ex. 55, it is clear from context that even with the use of \uff5e\u305f, \u4f5c\u308a\u51fa\u3059 itself very much is describing an onset, and a dangerous one at that. <br><br>Knowing how V<sub>1<\/sub> <em>can <\/em>be interpreted is crucial to understanding the role \uff5e\u51fa\u3059 is playing correctly, but what is especially crucial for you as a learner is that, as different as opposing contexts with the same verb has shown, those separate meanings of the compound will always be listed in Japanese dictionaries as separate entries. So, when you encounter a new compound with \uff5e\u51fa\u3059, first try looking up to see how many entries it has. If V<sub>1<\/sub> has multiple nuances, you might find multiple entries for the compound which will either go hand in hand with Meaning \u2460 and\/or \u2461.<br><br>Before looking at more example sentences, the chart below lists a healthy handful of verbs which, due to the nature of V<sub>1<\/sub>, would only be listed as \uff5e\u51fa\u3059 indicating a dramatic onset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td>V<sub>1<\/sub> \u9023\u7528\u5f62 + \uff5e\u51fa\u3059<\/td><td>Transitivity <\/td><td>Meaning<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u964d\u308a\u51fa\u3059<\/td><td>\u81ea\u52d5\u8a5e<\/td><td>To start to rain<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u6ce3\u304d\u51fa\u3059<\/td><td>\u81ea\u52d5\u8a5e<\/td><td>To burst into tears<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u6b69\u304d\u51fa\u3059<\/td><td>\u81ea\u52d5\u8a5e<\/td><td>To start walking<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u8d70\u308a\u51fa\u3059<\/td><td>\u81ea\u52d5\u8a5e<\/td><td>To break into a run<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>56. \u7531\u7f8e\u5b50\u3055\u3093\u304c\u6ce3\u304d\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>Yumiko broke into tears.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>57. \u7a81\u7136\u3001\u7537\u6027\u306e\u8077\u54e1\u4e00\u4eba\u304c<ruby>\u7b11<rt>\u308f\u3089<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3044\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>Suddenly, a male personnel member burst out laughing. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>58. \u5929\u8fba\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u3066\u8d70\u308a\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>I began running to reach the top. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>59. \u96e8\u304c\u964d\u308a\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>It began to rain (a lot).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\uff5e\u59cb\u3081\u308b vs \uff5e\u51fa\u3059<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The main reason for why so many similar yet different descriptions were given to describe the onset denoted by \uff5e\u51fa\u3059 is because of how speakers internalize some sort of intrinsic difference between it and something generally starting.
