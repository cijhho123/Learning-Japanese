Given that there are endless facets of use to these words, pay attention to what is mentioned. If you take anything as an absolute, you are not giving the material fair justice in interpretation. That&#8217;s not to say everything is up for grabs. Rather, the fluidity in pronoun usage must be viewed as fluid rather than being defined by strict perimeters.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a quick grammar note, Japanese pronouns (\u4ee3\u540d\u8a5e) act a lot like regular nouns, and one way we can prove that is simply from the fact that we&#8217;re talking about so many of them. One thing that you cannot do with them, for instance, is repeat them over and over again in the same sentence. It&#8217;s not just unnatural to do so, but it results in incorrect Japanese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u79c1\u306f\u79c1\u306e\u90e8\u5c4b\u3067\u79c1\u306e\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u79c1\u306e\u53cb\u9054\u3068\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002X<br>\u3000\u79c1\u306f\u90e8\u5c4b\u3067\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u53cb\u9054\u3068\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3007<br>\u3000I was talking with my friend with my computer in my room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other instances of first person are assumed as defaults unless situation says otherwise, in which case, you should use \u81ea\u5206 instead or some other pronoun other than first pronoun for the other instances for there to be a reason for qualifying. You will learn that although there are especially many first and second person pronouns to choose from, you should try to avoid using them whenever possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is because Japanese is a pro-drop language: it drops such pronouns unless there is a need to emphasize the information these pronouns give. For instance, topicalization, contrast, pointing out things are legitimate reasons to use them. Using them so much in a single assignment because you&#8217;re trying to make a certain word count and are ignoring proper Japanese grammar is not legitimate.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1st Person Pronouns<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u308f\u305f\u304f\u3057<\/strong>:&nbsp;This is a respectful pronoun and has been numerously defined by government guidelines as the proper first person pronoun of choice for polite speech and honorifics. However, the less polite but more neutral form \u308f\u305f\u3057 has surpassed it in frequency.&nbsp;In \u6f22\u5b57 both are \u79c1.&nbsp;\u308f\u305f\u304f\u3057 can sound pompous outside of honorifics. This, though, is due to a flouting of speech styles, not intrinsic in the word itself.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u308f\u305f\u3057<\/strong>: Overuse of this may sound slightly feminine. This is because the trend for men using it is going down, and given the business world esteems proper use of honorifics, \u308f\u305f\u304f\u3057 can potentially receive more currency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u3042\u3063\u3057<\/strong>: In the working class dialect of Tokyo Bay, you also hear \u3042\u3063\u3057, which ultimately comes from \u308f\u305f\u304f\u3057.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u308f\u3057<\/strong>: This is casual and used by men over 50 and by old people in general in some regions. As you can see, it is a contraction of \u308f\u305f\u3057. It is sometimes written in \u6f22\u5b57 as \u5102.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u3042\u305f\uff08\u304f\uff09\u3057<\/strong>&nbsp;: These are generally deemed to be feminine and causal. Considering the history of traditional feminine speech, this is somewhat ironic. It is certain, though, that the use of these pronouns in polite contexts makes a woman look less educated, despite how unfair it may seem from the use of a feminine word. They may&nbsp;also appear in \u4e0b\u753a speech of Tokyo by both men and women. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u3042\u305f\u3044<\/strong>: This is found in rougher casual speech of female speakers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u3046\u3061<\/strong>: This is often used by women in casual and polite settings; however, there are many regions in Japan where this is a commonplace pronoun used by both genders.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Usage Note<\/strong>:&nbsp;First person pronouns are often dropped and assumed in context.&nbsp;Don&#8217;t overuse them because it can make you sound egotistic.&nbsp;Don&#8217;t assume that the situations discussed are the only ones. Tone and one&#8217;s identity can change their implications a lot.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Practice (1)<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u3000\u3000\u3000Determine which first person pronoun the following people will most likely use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. A 50 year old man at home.&nbsp;<br>2. A foreigner visiting Japan.<br>3. A teacher speaking to her principal.<br>4. A female speaking to her boyfriend.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>5. A woman you see in an alley.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<ruby>\u50d5&nbsp;<rt>\u307c\u304f<\/rt><\/ruby>is the general pronoun for guys of any age. It is actually used by both genders in song. It may also be used to call for a boy child. \u50d5, due to its sense of humility, is appropriate in polite speech.&nbsp;<ruby>\u4ffa<rt>\u304a\u308c<\/rt><\/ruby>&nbsp;asserts masculinity and&nbsp;<ruby>\u4ffa\u69d8<rt>\u304a\u308c\u3055\u307e<\/rt><\/ruby>&nbsp;is a very pompous variant. \u304a\u3089 and \u304a\u3044\u3089 are slang, non-vulgar, country-like variants.&nbsp;<ruby>\u6211\u8f29<rt>\u308f\u304c\u306f\u3044<\/rt><\/ruby>&nbsp;is old-fashioned and pompous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another old-fashioned pronoun is&nbsp;<ruby>\u6211<rt>\u308f\u308c<\/rt><\/ruby>. It is normally used in set expressions. The form&nbsp;<ruby>\u6211<rt>\u308f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c is used in formal situations to mean &#8220;our&#8221;. Ex. &#8220;our country&#8221; is \u6211\u304c<ruby>\u56fd<\/ruby>. Finally,&nbsp;<ruby>\u6715<rt>\u3061\u3093<\/rt><\/ruby>&nbsp;is equivalent to the &#8220;royal we&#8221; used by the Emperor. Other archaic pronouns can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.imabi.net\/l216nounspronouns.htm#825855643\">Lesson 216<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Practice (2)<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determine which first person pronoun the following people will most likely use.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.

When being polite, attach -\u3055\u3093 to the name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a lot of second person pronouns to choose from. The most neutral is \u3042\u306a\u305f. It is direct, so use a name if possible. It can also mean &#8220;dear&#8221; when used by women to their spouses. \u3042\u3093\u305f is a rude variant in Standard Japanese when talking to someone, but it can be seen in casual situations. There are a lot of dialects in which it is the standard second person pronoun. So, know your listener.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A teacher with 50 kids wouldn&#8217;t refer to her pupils by name, though. Instead, she would use \u3042\u306a\u305f\u305f\u3061, the plural form of you. However, when you should be polite to an audience, use \u307f\u306a\u3055\u3093 (everyone).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ruby>\u541b<rt>\u304d\u307f<\/rt><\/ruby>&nbsp;is a common casual &#8220;you\u201d and it can be used towards subordinates and peers. It is also used by men to their lovers. However, this last usage may not be acceptable by some women. It can be seen by some as belittling while by some as intimate. From guy to guy, it may be seen as rude.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u304a<ruby>\u524d<rt>\u307e\u3048<\/rt><\/ruby>&nbsp;and \u304a\u3081\u30fc are often used in vulgar situations by guys. However, they may still be seen used in just casual situations. They are actually extremely commonly used by men in close company as a general word to use with no such stigma. Things are really different when you know someone personally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most other second person pronouns are&nbsp;<strong>very rude or old-fashioned&nbsp;<\/strong>but with various degrees of nuance: \u3066\u3081\u30fc (this is from \u3066\u307e\u3048 but the non-contracted form is not used anymore in regular conversation), \u304d\u3055\u307e \uff08\u8cb4\u69d8\uff09, \u304a\u306e\u308c (originally a first person reflexive pronoun meaning oneself, which it still means in set phrases), (\u304a)\u306c\u3057 (not that common), \u308f\u308c(most people don&#8217;t use it aside from actual delinquent speech, which was the basis for pop-culture usage such as in movies and manga), etc. You just don&#8217;t use these rude pronouns to people. They&#8217;re just like fighting words.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>History Note<\/strong>: It&#8217;s important to note that \u8cb4\u69d8 and \u304a\u524d used to be very honorific terms, and the former stayed slightly honorific up until the early Edo Period. \u304a\u306c\u3057 \uff08\u304a\u4e3b\uff09 also has honorific origin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. \u304a\u524d\u306f<ruby>\u8ca0<rt>\u307e<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3051\u308b\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; You will lose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. \u3042\u306a\u305f\u306b<ruby>\u4f1a<rt>\u3042<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#8217;ll meet with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><ruby>9. \u5c71\u672c<rt>\u3084\u307e\u3082\u3068<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3055\u3093\u306e\u30da\u30f3\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002(P)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Is this your pen Mr. Yamamoto?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10. \u3042\u3093\u305f\u306f\u305a\u308b\u3044\u3002(Casual; rude)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You&#8217;re sly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vocabulary Note<\/strong>: \u304a\u305f\u304f is a second person pronoun that shows light respect towards someone of relatively equal status.

Japanese actually prefers to avoid the words for he and she as they are more frequently used to refer to boyfriend and girlfriend. That does not mean, though, that you won&#8217;t seem them clearly used to mean &#8220;he&#8221; and &#8220;she&#8221; as this is extremely common in translated works, of which there are many, and you will still hear the pronoun meanings used in conversation.
