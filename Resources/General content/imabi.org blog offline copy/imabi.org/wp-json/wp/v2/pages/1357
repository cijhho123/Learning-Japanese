Most of them have become adverbial and or final particles. Their functions range from emphatic to interrogative usages, and this is often determined by careful attention to context.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bound particles&nbsp;require that the final verb phrase in their clause to be in a particular form. Most require the final verb phrase to be in the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 because, as we&#8217;ve seen, that can make verbs function as nominalized phrases in Classical Japanese.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the particles discussed in this lesson may not be exhaustive in accounting for all such particles in Classical Japanese, it will&nbsp;enable&nbsp;you to have a decent understanding of the some times very complex grammar rules that go with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The particles to be discussed are the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;Particle<\/td><td>&nbsp;The Fixed Base<\/td><td>&nbsp;Function(s)<\/td><td>&nbsp;Final Usages?<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u306f<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7d42\u6b62\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;Topic Marker<\/td><td>&nbsp;Yes<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u3082<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7d42\u6b62\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;Parallel listing<\/td><td>&nbsp;Yes<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u3084\uff08\u306f\uff09<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9023\u4f53\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;Doubt\/question<\/td><td>&nbsp;Yes<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u304b\uff08\u306f\uff09<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9023\u4f53\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;Doubt\/question<\/td><td>&nbsp;Yes<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u305e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9023\u4f53\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;Emphasis<\/td><td>&nbsp;Yes<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u306a\u3080\u30fb\u306a\u3093<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9023\u4f53\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;Emphasis<\/td><td>&nbsp;Yes<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u3053\u305d<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5df2\u7136\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;Strong emphasis<\/td><td>&nbsp;Yes<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: These particles have such a strong role in binding sentences in a certain form that even in their absence, when other elements that would be used in concert with them are showing doubt or a rhetorical question, as is an important usage for particles like \u305e, \u306a\u3080, \u3084, and \u304b, the sentence may still be seen bound in the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62. No wonder the \u7d42\u6b62\u5f62 and \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 merged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u306f<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The particle \u306f is as you should certainly know is extremely important in Modern Japanese. However, there was a point in time where it was not used, and it has taken centuries for the \u304cVS\u306f rivalry to get to its present form. In fact, the thing that rivaled \u306f, which shows known information, was \u3082, which could present new information. Where did this particle come from? It likely has origin with the particle \u3070, but it is certain that by the \u5e73\u5b89\u6642\u4ee3 its usages had become greatly varied and increasingly more complex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we know that it marks the topic. This topic is emphasized and often made distinct from other things, which is why we still often translate it into English with &#8220;as for&#8221;. This topic is what the explanation\/predicate is going to be about. It can be used with parallel items to show comparison and or contrast. Of course, it still has the role of highlighting the negative.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you saw from above, it can also be used with other bound particles, and it can also be used as a final particle. That&#8217;s right. Although modern orthography changes doesn&#8217;t make this obvious, the adverbial \u306f and final particle \u308f of Modern Japanese are from the same thing. When it comes at the end, the verb has to go to the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62\uff0cwhich is the common trait for bound particles.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: Remember from previous lessons that \u306f can attach to an adjective \u9023\u7528\u5f62 or -\u305a to create a hypothetical situation, and \u305a+\u306f often makes \u305a(\u3093)\u3070. Also remember that \u3092+\u306f = \u3092\u3070.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>Examples<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u53e4\u4eac\u306f\u3059\u3067\u306b\u8352\u308c\u3066\u3001\u65b0\u90fd\u306f\u3044\u307e\u3060\u6210\u3089\u305a\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The old capital has already been ravaged, and the new capital has still not been materialized.<br>From the \u65b9\u4e08\u8a18.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u4eba\u59bb\u5c13\u3000\u8a00\u8005\u8ab0\u4e8b\u3000\u9162\u8863\u4e43\u3000\u6b64\u7d10\u89e3\u8de1\u3000\u8a00\u8005\u5b70\u8a00\u3000(\u539f\u6587)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; \u4eba\u59bb\u306b\u8a00\u3075\u306f<ruby>\u8ab0<rt>\u305f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c<ruby>\u8a00<rt>\u3053\u3068<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3055\u8863\u306e\u3053\u306e\u7d10\u89e3\u3051\u3068\u8a00\u3075\u306f\u8ab0\u304c\u8a00<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who calls for me, a married woman?
