However, Japanese grammar does not have grammatical number. This fact is very hard for beginners to grasp, but given now that you have had more experience in Japanese, it is time to look at this serious issue in greater detail.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Terminology Note<\/strong>: Indo-European (\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u7956\u8a9e) simply refers to the ancestral language that ties English with most languages from Europe to India. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lack of Grammatical Number<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the fact that Japanese doesn&#8217;t have grammatical number doesn&#8217;t mean that Japanese lacks the ability to differentiate between something that is singular and something that is plural. After all, if you use quantity qualifiers such as \u591a\u304f\u306e or \u5c11\u3057\u306e, there isn&#8217;t any problem in telling whether someone is referring to just one thing or more than one of something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u82b1\u304c\u305f\u304f\u3055\u3093\u54b2\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002<br>\u3000 &nbsp;There are a lot of flower<strong>s<\/strong>&nbsp;blooming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noun classification differs considerably between English and Japanese. In English, when we sense that something is more than 1, we attribute that to being plural and unconsciously use a form of \u2013s, ignoring instances where the singular and plural form are the same and other such irregularities. All Japanese nouns are \u5168\u90e8<ruby>\u62bd\u8c61<rt>\u3061\u3085\u3046\u3057\u3087\u3046<\/rt><\/ruby>\u540d\u8a5e. So, there is a vague feeling in comparing it to English. So, if you were to want to say 2 pens, you would say 2\u672c\u306e\u30da\u30f3. There is no reason to ever have any inflection on \u30da\u30f3.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In English, there are also nouns that are countable and others that are not countable. For example, chalk isn&#8217;t countable. \u201cChalks\u201d would refer to different kinds of chalk, not there being two pieces of chalk. In Japanese, no such distinctions are made. There are counter phrases that help bridge this gap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grammatical number in English also has a direct correlation with numbers themselves. In Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, there is but one God. However, in Japanese, you have the well-known yet often misunderstood phrase&nbsp;<ruby>\u5927\u548c<rt>\u3084\u307e\u3068<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306b\u306f<ruby>\u516b\u767e\u4e07<rt>\u3084\u304a\u3088\u308d\u305a<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e\u795e\u304c\u3042\u308b. This is not saying that there is some exact number of \u795e in Japanese, but that there is a lot. 8, 9, 10, and 10,000 were often used in the ancient period to refer to a lot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, the items that do express plurality in Japanese are different from grammatical number in the sense that added nuances are attributed to particular endings, and these particular endings are used with particular nouns. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Form Note<\/strong>: There are rare instances in Japanese that hint that Japanese did have a clearer distinction of plurality in some words. For instance, \u3072 becoming \u304b in counters after 1. 1 day used to be \u3072\u3068\u3072. Then, 2 days is \u3075\u3064\u304b. Notice the change? The same thing goes for people. You get \u3072\u3068\u308a but then \u3075\u305f\u308a, \u307f\u305f\u308a, \u3088\u305f\u308a. This \u3068\u308a \u2192 \u305f\u308a is of the same vein as \u3072 \u2192 \u304b. In fact, there&#8217;s even an old phrase \u65e5\u4e26\u3079\u3066 \uff08\u304b\u306a\u3079\u3066\uff09 that refers to days one after another.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\uff5e\u305f\u3061\uff65\u9054<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>More frequently written in \u6f22\u5b57 in literature, the suffix \uff5e\u305f\u3061 is the closest thing in Japanese to the \u201c-s\u201d in English. However, it typically indicates a group of things. For instance, when you say \u77f3\u7530\u541b\u305f\u3061, \u77f3\u7530\u541b is pointed out as the head of a group of a multitude of people, which could be his family or his group of friends. Thus, correct interpretation of a phrase with \uff5e\u305f\u3061 is heavily sensitive to context.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u79c1\u305f\u3061\u306f\u8cdb\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; We agree.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u5c71\u7530\u541b\u305f\u3061\u3001\u982d\u304c\u60aa\u3044\u306d\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yamada&#8217;s group isn&#8217;t smart.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u7406\u4e8b\u305f\u3061\u306f\u3001\u5927\u5cf6\u7406\u4e8b\u9577\u6392\u65a5\u306b\u624b\u3092\u3064\u3051\u308b\u3068\u8a00\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The directors said that they would start work on the boycott of Board Chairman Ohshima.<br>From \u6df7\u58f0\u306e\u68ee (\u4e0b) by \u677e\u672c\u6e05\u5f35.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. \u6570\u3005\u306e\u3059\u3070\u3089\u3057\u3044\u30d2\u30c3\u30c8\u66f2\u3092\u307e\u3060\u307e\u3060\u305f\u304f\u3055\u3093\u306e\u65b9\u305f\u3061\u306b\u5c4a\u3051\u7d9a\u3051\u3066\u307b\u3057\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I wanted [her] to still continue delivering many wonderful hit songs to a lot of people.<br>From the words of the singer \u516b\u4ee3\u4e9c\u7d00 upon hearing the death of singer \u85e4\u572d\u5b50.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another related issue is something like \u72ac\u305f\u3061. Although this could very well mean \u201cdogs\u201d, depending on context, it could also comprehensively refer to a multitude of all sorts of (similar) animals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: Unless if something that could be viewed as belonging in a group like a boat in a fleet, plural suffixes are rarely ever used with inanimate nouns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Word Note<\/strong>: \u53cb\u9054, note the voicing of \uff5e\u305f\u3061, can still be used even if you are referring to just one friend. This shows how fragile the nuances of these endings are. This is all possible due to the lack of grammatical number. This is of the same vein as \u5b50\u4f9b, which will be touched on later in this lesson. However, \u53cb\u305f\u3061 is possible, which would refer to there being a plurality in friends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Classical Japanese Note<\/strong>: \uff5e\u9054 started out as a very respectful suffix used with \u795e\u30fb\u8cb4\u4eba \u201caristocrat\u201d (<ruby>\u516c\u9054<rt>\u304d\u3093\u3060\u3061<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3000\uff1d Kings; children of nobles; nobleman\/noblemen). It eventually lessened to being used with light respect, and in Modern Japanese it is no longer honorific. Notice how the ambiguity in plurality has existed when the suffix is voiced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\uff5e\u3089\u30fb\u7b49<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\uff5e<strong>\u3089<\/strong>&nbsp;is casual, so it should not be used with \u308f\u305f\u304f\u3057. However, it does get used with \u308f\u305f\u3057\u3089. This, though, is not that common in \u6a19\u6e96\u8a9e.

To make things more weird, \u5f7c\u3089 is far more common than \u5f7c\u305f\u3061. For nouns of person, \u3089 is the ideal choice in formalized speech.
