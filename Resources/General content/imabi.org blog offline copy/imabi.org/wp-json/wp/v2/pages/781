The meaning is doubled, which should make it ungrammatical. However, you still see it used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Verb Note<\/strong>: \u306a\u3059 is the transitive verb pair for \u306a\u308b and is used just like \u3059\u308b. It is only used in the spoken language in expressions like \u8ca1\u3092\u306a\u3059(to build a fortune), \u8272\u3092\u306a\u3059 (to change one&#8217;s complexion when angry), \u6210\u3057\u9042\u3052\u308b (to accomplish), etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In speaking of \u306a\u3059, \u306a\u305b\u308b can&#8217;t be used as the potential form. This is because it would be a look alike to the actual interpretation of &#8220;done&#8221;. In Classical Japanese, there was an auxiliary equivalent to English&#8217;s perfect tenses: \u308a. This attached to the \u5df2\u7136\u5f62. So, you would get \u306a\u305b\u308a. When used before a noun, it becomes \u306a\u305b\u308b. This grammar point is only found in set phrases.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>23. \u795e\u306e\u306a\u305b\u308b\u696d<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An act of God&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>24. \u3088\u3046\u3084\u304f<ruby>\u6575<rt>\u3066\u304d<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e\u76ee\u3092<ruby>\u9003<rt>\u306e\u304c<\/rt><\/ruby>\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u5f97\u305f\u3002&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was finally able to get away from the watch of the enemy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>25. \u4e8b\u60c5\u3092\u805e\u304b\u3056\u308b\u3092\u5f97\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We will have no choice but to question.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, the verb \u5f97\u308b can also function as a potential verb, which makes sense if it can do so as a supplementary verb. Here, in these rare cases it is always after \u3092 and usually after a nominalized form of a verb. In the case of \uff5e\u3056\u308b, the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 of the classical negative auxiliary \uff5e\u305a, case particles after the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 was sufficient in Classical Japanese to use a verb phrase as a noun. So, the same principles still apply. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>History Note<\/strong>: The sound change that lead to independent potential verbs for \u4e94\u6bb5 verbs is uncertain. One idea is that it is a contraction of the \u9023\u7528\u5f62 of \u4e94\u6bb5 verbs plus \uff5e\u5f97\u308b.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ex. \u66f8\u304d\u5f97\u308b\u3000\u2192 \u66f8\u3051\u308b<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A more plausible account, however, is that a subset of intransitive verbs that showed spontaneity (phenomena that occur naturally) promoted the generalization to all \u4e94\u6bb5 verbs.&nbsp;Also, historically, the endings \uff5e\u3089\u308c\u308b and \uff5e\u308c\u308b, though different in appearance, have stood for and continue to be used for not only potential but also passivization, spontaneity, and light honorifics. It&#8217;s believed, though, that the root usage is to show spontaneity. For a potential pattern to evolve from another line of spontaneity phrases shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise in light of this.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Potential III This lesson will focus on more difficult potential phrases in Japanese.
