This is, Japanese tends to not like different vowels right next to each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many dialects (mostly northern and eastern) including casual Tokyo Dialect (\u6771\u4eac\u5f01), \/ai\/,\u00a0\/oi\/, and\u00a0\/ii\/\u00a0at the end of adjectives contract to\u00a0[\u0113]\u00a0in slang. Less commonly, those that end in \/ui\/ may be found contracted to [\u0113] or [ii]. This phenomenon has existed in some capacity in Japanese for quite some time. In fact, outside of adjectives, you will find plenty of words contracted with the same premise. For instance, the curse words for &#8220;you&#8221;\u2014\u304a\u524d and\u00a0\u624b\u524d\u2014are very frequently pronounced as\u00a0\u304a\u3081\u30fc and\u00a0\u3066\u3081\u30fc instead. Again, this is by no mistake.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Sound Changes Affect Adjectives<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Returning to how this applies to adjectives, in Standard Japanese there is no instance of the syllables \/ye\/ and \/we\/, at least in native vocabulary, which means if the sound change \/ai\/, \/oi\/, \/ii\/ \u2192 [\u0113] causes either of those two syllables to form, \/y\/ and \/w\/ just drop altogether. An example of this is the adjectives \u5f37\u3044 (strong). Its contracted form is \/tsu\u0113\/, not \/tsuy\u0113\/. In the examples below, you will find examples of these contracted adjectives in their glory. Unsurprisingly, this will be a wonderful opportunity to familiarize with some of the most iconic dialectical phrases in Japanese. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u3042\u306e\u670d\u3001\u307b\u3093\u307e\u306b\u3048\u3048\u306d\u3093\u3002\uff08\uff1d\u3042\u306e\u670d\u3001\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u3044\u3044\u3093\u3060\u3088\uff09<br>Those clothes are really good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u3048\u3048\u3084\u306a\u3044\u304b\uff01\u3000\uff08\uff1d\u3044\u3044\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u304b\uff09<br>Isn\u2019t it great?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u3048\u3048\u3093\u3061\u3083\u3046\u304b\uff1f\u3000\uff08\uff1d\u3044\u3044\u3093\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3060\u308d\u3046\u304b\uff1f\uff09<br>Is it not great?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: \u3061\u3083\u3046 is a contraction of \u9055\u3046 and is used in many Western dialects to ask if something is, in fact, not the case while still seeking a positive affirmation.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u3042\u306e\u30b5\u30e1\u3001\u6016\u3048\u3047\u3047\uff01\u3000\uff08\uff1d\u3042\u306e\u30b5\u30e1\u3001\u6016\u3044\uff01\uff09<br>That shark is scary!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. \u3059\u3052\u30fc\u3060\u308d\uff01\u3000\uff08\uff1d\u3059\u3054\u3044\u3060\u308d\u3046\uff01\uff09<br>Isn\u2019t that cool!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. \u3081\u3063\u3061\u3083\u7720\u3066\u30fc\uff01\u3000\uff08\uff1d\u3068\u3063\u3066\u3082\u7720\u305f\u3044\uff01\uff09<br>I\u2019m really sleepy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. \u51b7\u8535\u5eab\u3082\u4f55\u306b\u3082\u306d\u3048\uff01\u3000\uff08\uff1d\u51b7\u8535\u5eab\u3082\u4f55\u3082\u306a\u3044\uff01\uff09<br>There\u2019s nothing in the fridge!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. \u3046\u3063\u305b\u30fc\u306a\u3001\u3066\u3081\u30fc\u3002\u3000\uff08\uff1d\u3046\u308b\u3055\u3044\u3001\u304a\u524d\uff09<br>Shut up, you.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sound change also affects grammatical endings such as\u00a0\uff5e\u306a\u3044 and\u00a0\uff5e\u305f\u3044<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9. \u5f31\u3047\u5974\u306f\u7740\u308b\u670d\u3082\u9078\u3079\u306d\u30a7\uff01\u3000\uff08\uff1d\u5f31\u3044\u5974\u306f\u7740\u308b\u670d\u3082\u9078\u3079\u306a\u3044\uff01\uff09<br>Weak guys can\u2019t even choose their own clothes to wear!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10. \u305f\u304f\u3055\u3093\u98df\u3079\u3066\u30fc\u306a\u3041\u3002\u3000\uff08\uff1d\u305f\u304f\u3055\u3093\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3044\u306a\u3041\uff09<br>Man, I wanna eat a lot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11. \u304f\u3060\u3089\u306d\u30fc\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3044\u3061\u3044\u3061\u7a81\u3063\u304b\u304b\u3063\u3066\u304f\u3093\u3058\u3083\u306d\u30fc\u3088\u3002\uff08\uff1d\u4e0b\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3044\u3061\u3044\u3061\u7a81\u3063\u304b\u304b\u3063\u3066\u3044\u304f\u3093\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3088\uff09<br>You can\u2019t be charging at me with every little stupid thing. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12. \u3064\u307e\u3093\u306d\u30fc\u3053\u3068\u805e\u304f\u306a\u3088\u3002\uff08\uff1d\u3064\u307e\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3068\u3092\u805e\u304f\u306a\u3088\uff09<br>Don\u2019t ask absurd things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One must understand that the productivity of this sound change is not applied to all adjectives.
