Historically, many transitive verbs are derived by adding \u3059 to a stem, creating naturally causative-like expressions. So, \u71c3\u3084\u3059 describes the event of someone putting something on fire. The thing doesn&#8217;t just spontaneously ignite. If it were to, you would use the intransitive \u71c3\u3048\u308b. Yet, the causative forms for both \u71c3\u3048\u308b and \u71c3\u3084\u3059 involve using a form ultimately coming from the same source as \u3059 that makes so many transitive verbs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;Verb Root<\/td><td>&nbsp;Intransitive<\/td><td>&nbsp;Intransitive Causative<\/td><td>&nbsp;Transitive<\/td><td>&nbsp;Transitive Causative<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;moy-<\/td><td>&nbsp;<em>moeru<\/em><br>&nbsp;to burn<\/td><td>&nbsp;<em>moesaseru<\/em><br>&nbsp;to make X burn<\/td><td>&nbsp;<em>moyasu<\/em><br>&nbsp;to burn X<\/td><td>&nbsp;<em>moyasaseru<\/em><br>&nbsp;to make someone burn X<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One would hope that this could be straightforward for every verb, but reality tells otherwise. There is also the short causative \u71c3\u3048\u3055\u3059 for \u71c3\u3048\u3055\u305b\u308b, but this form is usually \u25b3\u30fbX for most speakers. If the verb in the base form were a \u4e94\u6bb5 verb not ending in \u3059, then it would be OK to anyone. Due to the fact that \u305b\u308b comes from \u3059, the \u3059 in more and more transitive verbs is starting to become \u305b\u308b. This lesson will explain the ins and outs of this problem. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Corrupted Transitive Verb Forms<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>Intransitive \u2192\u3000Transitive and or Intransitive Causative<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, the causative endings were \u3055\u3059 and \u3059. The \u3059 ending transitives and causative phrases is the same word, ignoring conjugation differences. Odd vowel changes may happen when attaching \u3059 to make transitives, but they all semantically resemble causative phrases.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;To burn\u3000\u2192\u3000To burn it<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u71c3\u3048\u308b\u3000\u2192\u3000\u71c3\u3084\u3059<\/td><td>&nbsp;To boil\u3000\u2192\u3000To boil it<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u6cb8\u304f\u3000\u2192\u3000\u6cb8\u304b\u3059<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;To get off \u2192 To drop off<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u964d\u308a\u308b\u3000\u2192\u3000\u964d\u308d\u3059<\/td><td>&nbsp;To melt \u2192\u3000To melt it<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u6eb6\u304f\u3000\u2192\u3000\u6eb6\u304b\u3059<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; On the left side, we have verbs with transitive forms and intransitive causative forms. That means \u71c3\u3048\u3055\u305b\u308b\u30fb\u71c3\u3084\u3059 and \u964d\u308a\u3055\u305b\u308b\u30fb\u964d\u308d\u3059 are all words with&nbsp;<strong>significant difference<\/strong>&nbsp;in meaning. On the right side, we have verbs with no intransitive causative form. These forms, though, look and act like intransitive causative phrases. Verbs like on the left are able to have both forms with the aid of \u3055 insertion. What then would need to happen in form for verbs on the right to have a&nbsp;<em>causative<\/em>&nbsp;form? &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If \uff5e\u305b\u308b comes from \u3059, then \uff5e\u305b\u308b should be able to be used just like \uff5e\u3055\u305b\u308b to create intransitive causative phrases. Consider \u6f84\u3080 (to be transparent).&nbsp;\u6f84\u3080&#8217;s transitive form is \u6f84\u307e\u3059, which is causative in nature. A causative form of \u6f84\u3080 would be identical in meaning to a transitive form. So, \u6f84\u307e\u305b\u308b would be the potential form of \u6f84\u307e\u3059. Nevertheless, because \u6f84\u307e\u3059 is causative in nature, the \u3059 is seen by more speakers as the short causative and changing it to \u6f84\u307e\u305b\u308b for the causative. Even so, no one would ever have a problem telling when \u6f84\u307e\u305b\u308b is meant to be the causative or potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, which transitive verbs ending in \u3059 are vulnerable to changing to end in \u305b\u308b? Certainly, any intransitive verb with no distinct transitive and intransitive causative form is vulnerable. As we look at individual cases of this change, the majority fall under this situation. Even so, -asu is becoming more stigmatic of dialectical speech. Thus, verbs with intransitive causative and transitive verbs are now starting to have the transitive form ending in \u305b\u308b. \u6cb8\u304b\u3059 and \u6eb6\u304b\u3059 are more vulnerable to change than \u71c3\u3084\u3059, but the verb \u7518\u3084\u304b\u3059 (to spoil), which you&#8217;ll see later as well, has already changed for some speakers to \u7518\u3084\u304b\u305b\u308b. This is despite the fact that \u7518\u3048\u3055\u305b\u308b exists. This means that one day speakers may use \u71c3\u3084\u305b\u308b to mean &#8220;to burn X&#8221;.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>Comparing Old and Modern Conjugations<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To tell whether an intransitive verb has both a causative and transitive form, let&#8217;s compare the modern and old conjugations for the causative. \u3055\u305b\u308b and \u305b\u308b come from \u3055\u3059 and \u3059. They did not conjugate exactly like \u3059\uff08\u308b\uff09 as in the present or the past, but they were still similar due to them sharing the same origin. The chart below show shows the old causative conjugations and the modern ones (short and long). As you can see, although the short causative is a retention of the old, some change has occurred.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u672a\u7136\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9023\u7528\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7d42\u6b62\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9023\u4f53\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5df2\u7136\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u547d\u4ee4\u5f62<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Old \u3055\u3059<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3055\u305b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3055\u305b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3055\u3059<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3055\u3059\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3055\u3059\u308c<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3055\u305b\u3088<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Old \u3059<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3059<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3059\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3059\u308c<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305b\u3088<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Modern \u3055\u305b\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3055\u305b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3055\u305b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3055\u305b\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3055\u305b\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3055\u305b\u308c<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3055\u305b\u308d<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Modern \u305b\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305b\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305b\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305b\u308c<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305b\u308d<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Modern \u3055\u3059<\/td><td>&nbsp;X<\/td><td>&nbsp;(\u3057)<\/td><td>&nbsp;(\u3055\u3059)&nbsp;<\/td><td>&nbsp;X<\/td><td>&nbsp;X<\/td><td>&nbsp;X<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Modern \u3059<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3055<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3057<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3059<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3059<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u305b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\uff08\u305b\uff09<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The modern \u3055\u3059 is almost nonexistent in Standard Japanese. Its usage is usually dialectical. As for the modern \u3059, it is still really productive. Its \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 and \u5df2\u7136\u5f62 are not as common, but they&#8217;re usually not felt as being wrong. The \u547d\u4ee4\u5f62 is questionable to some speakers, so it will be left in parentheses. Aside from the short causative-passive usage of the \u672a\u7136\u5f62 with the modern \u3059, the modern long causative forms are the most used (and at times the only ones you can\/should use).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, \u3055\u3059 has almost died out. Any instance of it is dialectical. The modern \u3059 is also starting to die. Signs of this are evident in the chart. One base is already questionable, and as stated above, aside from the short-causative passive, you&#8217;re likely to use the modern \u305b\u308b. If the language is hating on -asu, then it&#8217;s no wonder transitive verbs ending in this are starting to end in -aseru. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Case-by-Case Study<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, we have seen what verbs are being most affected, and we&#8217;ve even looked at the causative conjugations of the past and present and found yet another source of the problem.

Some speakers even think \u6ce3\u304b\u3057\u305f is dialectical, but there are still conjugations where they&#8217;re both more or less just as common.

The first is a good thing and the second is a bad thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intransitive verbs with causative-like transitive forms do exist, but the causative should still come from the transitive version of the verb. These include verbs like \u9cf4\u308b and \u6563\u308b, but they&#8217;re in the minority. For instance, \u7167\u308b means &#8220;to shine&#8221; and \u7167\u3089\u3059 means &#8220;to brighten&#8221;, but the causative is \u7167\u3089\u3055\u305b\u308b.&nbsp;You cannot find \u7167\u3089\u305b\u308b to mean \u7167\u3089\u3059. It is the potential as expected.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, more verbs will switch over to having their transitive forms end in \u305b\u308b. This lesson was about transitive verbs having corrupted forms due to the causative. This confusion arose due to common etymology, and there is various degrees of acceptance of variant forms. This is what you can expect in a wider change affecting the entire language. Sadly, this will only be truly easy centuries later when this change has fully taken effect. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Examples<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forms are listed from most to least common.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u98df\u4e8b\u3092\uff5b\u6e08\u307e\u305b\u308b\u30fb\u6e08\u307e\u3059\uff5d\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; To finish supper.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u77e5\u8b58\u3092\uff5b\u3072\u3051\u3089\u304b\u3059 \u3007\u30fb\u3072\u3051\u3089\u304b\u305b\u308b \u25b3\uff5d\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; To show off one&#8217;s knowledge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u5b50\u4f9b\u3092\uff5b\u7518\u3084\u304b\u3059 \u3007\u30fb\u7518\u3084\u304b\u305b\u308b\u3000\u25b3\uff5d\u3002&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To spoil one&#8217;s\/a children.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u8074\u8846\u3092{\u98fd\u304d\u3055\u305b\u306a\u3044\u30fb\u98fd\u304b\u3055\u306a\u3044\u30fb\u98fd\u304b\u305b\u306a\u3044\uff5d\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t bore the crowd.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Causative II: The Corruption of Transitive Verbs&nbsp; Causative conjugations in Japanese are complicated.<a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/imabi.org\/causative-form-issues\/\">\u7d9a\u304d\u3092\u8aad\u3080 <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">&#8220;Causative Form Issues&#8221;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":158153075,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"footnotes":""},"tags":[],"class_list":["post-629","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry"],"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/PeXUlI-a9","jetpack-related-posts":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/629","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/158153075"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=629"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/629\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":6816,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/629\/revisions\/6816"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=629"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=629"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
