That means you should treat it like an adjective, this is despite that in English the phrase is treated as a verb. The phrase, though, does come from a verb. The verb form \u597d\u304fis limited to the passive form, and outside of this, other instances are typically set phrases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Set Phrases Note<\/strong>: Below are some common set phrases utilizing different forms of \u597d\u304f.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10.&nbsp;<ruby>\u8ced<rt>\u304b<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3051<ruby>\u4e8b<rt>\u3054\u3068<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306f\uff5b\u3059\u304b\u306a\u3044\u30fb\u3059\u304b\u3093\uff5d\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can\u2019t stand gambling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11. \u3042\u3044\u3064\u306f\u866b\u304c\u3059\u304b\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I especially hate that guy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12. \u597d\u3044\u305f\u3089\u3057\u3044\u4eba\u3060\u3068\u601d\u3046\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think that person is delightful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Particle Note<\/strong>: Particle usage is also something to keep in mind. When you say that you like something, this is generally new information that you are trying to tell someone. So, because this is the case and you are using an adjectival expression, you should say X\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3060. However, due to influence from Western languages, primarily English, \uff5e\u3092\u597d\u304d\u3060 has become acceptable for many younger speakers (those ~35 and under).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13. \u3042\u305f\u3057\u3092\u597d\u304d\u306a\u306e\uff1f \uff08Feminine\uff09<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do you like me?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14. \u30d6\u30b9\u3092\u597d\u304d\u306b\u306a\u308b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u6559\u3048\u3066\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Teach me how to like an ugly person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>15. \u3042\u3093\u305f\u306e\u919c\u3044\u72ac\u3081\u3092\u597d\u304d\u306b\u306a\u308b\u304f\u3089\u3044\u306b\u3000(\u5931\u793c!)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the point of liking your ugly dog&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a tendency for \u3092 to be more accepted the longer the sentence is. It is wrong to say that this is \u201cbad Japanese\u201d. This is just an instance of the language evolving. However, when you are speaking politely, you shouldn&#8217;t use something casual.
