As for X\u3092Y\u306b\u6bd4\u3079\u308b, Y is viewed as the standard for which the contrast that follows is based. Imagine with \u3068 that X and Y are brought together and compared side by side (X\u2192\u2190Y), while with \u306b, the direction of focus is pointed at Y (X\u2192Y). Consequently, because the focus is pointed at Y with \u306b, it carries an implication about the merits of the comparison, which is not had with \u3068. <br><br>Instead of seeing this grammar point rendered in the \u3066 form, you may also see it without \u3066 in formal speech (\u9023\u7528\u5f62\u4e2d\u6b62\u6cd5), or you may even see \u6bd4\u3079\u308b\u3068 or any other conditional provided that you account for the unique layer of nuancing provided by said conditional grammar pattern &#8211; with \u6bd4\u3079\u308b\u3068 being neutral but to the point. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u5916\u306f\u6691\u3044\u304c\u3001\u305d\u308c\u306b\u6bd4\u3079\u3066\u4e2d\u306f\u5bd2\u3044\u3002<br>It&#8217;s hot outside, but, moreover, in contrast, it&#8217;s cold inside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u3053\u306e\u672c\u306f\u6628\u65e5\u8aad\u3093\u3060\u306e\u3068\u6bd4\u3079\u308b\u3068\u5168\u304f\u3064\u307e\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>This book compared to the one I read yesterday is completely boring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u5f7c\u306f\u59b9\u3068\u6bd4\u3079\u3066\u82e5\u304f\u898b\u3048\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>He looked younger beside his younger sister.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u4eca\u5e74\u306f\u53bb\u5e74\u306b\u6bd4\u3079\u3001\u96ea\u306e<ruby>\u91cf<rt>\u308a\u3087\u3046<\/rt><\/ruby>\u304c\u591a\u3044\u3002<br>In contrast to last year, there has been a lot of snowfall this year.<br><br>5. \u6b27\u7c73\u8af8\u56fd\u306e\u85ac\u5264\u8cbb\u304c\u5168\u4f53\u306e\u4e00\u3007\uff5e\u30cb\u3007\uff05\u306b\u3068\u3069\u307e\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u306b\u8f03\u3079\u3066\u7570\u5e38\u306a\u6570\u5024\u3060\u3002<br>(That) is a bizarre figure in comparison to the pharmaceutical costs of Western countries being confined to 10~20% of their total (costs).<br><br><strong>Orthography Note<\/strong>: In formal writing, you may also see the verb \u6bd4\u3079\u308b spelled as \u8f03\u3079\u308b.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\uff5e\u306b\u5f15\u304d\u63db\u3048 vs \uff5e\u3068\u5f15\u304d\u63db\u3048\u306b<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The verb \u5f15\u304d\u63db\u3048\u308b has two definitions, each which produces two unique grammar structures which hinge on how \u306b and \u3068 differ as standard markers. <br><br>The pattern \uff5e\u306b\u5f15\u304d\u63db\u3048 follows nouns or nominalized expressions to indicate a sharp contrast, one that is both subjective and pertaining to a good vs. bad judgment call by the speaker. <br><br>When following nominalized expressions, the nominalizer of choice is the particle \u306e, as is to be expected due to the highly subjective nature of this pattern.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. \u5065\u592a\u306e\u4f4f\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b\u30de\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306f\u65b0\u3057\u304f\u3066\u3001\u5e83\u3044\u3002\u305d\u308c\u306b\u5f15\u304d\u63db\u3048\u3001\u50d5\u306e\u3068\u3053\u308d\u306f\u53e4\u304f\u3066\u72ed\u3044\u3057\u3001\u99c5\u304b\u3089\u3082\u9060\u3044\u3088\u3002<br>The apartment that Kenta is living at is new and wide.
