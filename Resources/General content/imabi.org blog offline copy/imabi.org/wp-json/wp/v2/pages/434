So, the difference lies in where the honorific element of the verb phrase is.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>17a. \u8a02\u6b63\u3055\u308c\u3066\u307f\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\u25b3<br>17b. \u8a02\u6b63\u306a\u3055\u3063\u3066\u307f\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\u3007<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please try to revise\/edit it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This shows that lowering honorific standards causes problems. The first sentence may make someone sound uneducated. The second sentence comes from fears of being too pushy, which \uff5e\u306a\u3055\u3044 in other contexts gives.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To complicate things more, \uff5e\u3066\u3054\u89a7\u306a\u3055\u3044 may not always be appropriate. However, \uff5e\u3066\u307f\u308b is typically not used in other conjugations in honorific fashion as mentioning superiors trying things is not formal. Rather, things like \uff5e\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304f &#8220;receiving the act of&#8230;(by\/from&#8230;.)&#8221; would be used.
