On the other hand, \uff5e\u3066\u4ee5\u6765 is more appropriate in the written language.

It is important to understand now that what is to be described is now more often than not the case if you were to talk to speakers of the younger generation. However, knowing what has traditionally been went will help you when you see these phrases used in literature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\uff5e\u3066\u304b\u3089\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3082\u306e usually has a general negative evaluation of Situation B. There is the thought in the speaker that things could be a whole lot better, and there is thus a sense of severity of seriousness involved. Contrarily, \uff5e\u3066\u4ee5\u6765 is the opposite and generally has Situation B be positive. Both are ungrammatical, though, if Situation B is not continuing. So, neither allows Situation B to be the instant of a change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, not even \uff5e\u3066\u304b\u3089\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3082\u306e is used that much in the spoken language. It has essentially become almost as \u66f8\u304d\u8a00\u8449\u7684 as \uff5e\u3066\u4ee5\u6765 despite not being a Sino-Japanese phrase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Situation B has its limitations, there is historically no problem in negating it within the same sentence afterward. In order for this to work for both, a \u671f\u9593 (time period) phrase such as #\u5e74 is attached after \uff5e\u3066\u304b\u3089 or \uff5e\u3066\u4ee5\u6765. So, you get \uff5e\u3066\u304b\u3089#\u5e74\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3082\u306e or \uff5e\u3066\u4ee5\u6765#\u5e74\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3082\u306e.
