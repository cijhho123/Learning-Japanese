In English, it is appropriate to simply accept the money with a &#8220;thank you&#8221; and then go about finalizing the payment, giving change back if necessary. This is not the case in Japanese. The employee must state in a humble fashion that they are accepting the payment. This, though, is rather complicated and businesses may differ in how they teach their employees to word this.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12a. 1\u4e07\u5186\u304b\u3089\u304a\u9810\u304b\u308a\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002X<br>12b. 1\u4e07\u5186\u304a\u9810\u304b\u308a\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u25b3\u30fb\u3007\u30fb\u25ce<br>12c. 1\u4e07\u5186\u304a\u53d7\u3051\u53d6\u308a(\u3044\u305f)\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u25ce?\u30fb\u25b3<br>I am being entrusted with this&nbsp;\u00a510,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12b. is currently the industry standard for when change is to be given back to the guest as the establishment is being &#8220;entrusted&#8221; with more many than is due. The inclusion of the particle \u304b\u3089 after the total given is incredibly common, but this is from confusing \u9810\u304b\u308b (to withhold\/be entrusted with\/hold onto)&nbsp;with \u53d7\u3051\u53d6\u308b (to accept).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since \u9810\u304b\u308b means&nbsp;that you are holding onto something for someone,&nbsp;some argue that you as a worker are not&nbsp;<em>really<\/em>&nbsp;just holding onto the money like you would a suitcase. You&#8217;re accepting it as payment. Those&nbsp;grammar hawks suggest using (12c) and those same speakers&nbsp;will also say that using \u304b\u3089 would make more sense here&nbsp;because you would be telling the customer outright that you are subtracting the total from the larger sum provided.&nbsp;In reality,&nbsp;12c.&nbsp;is overwhelmingly NOT used by&nbsp;the service industry itself, and for that reason, it is also marked as unnatural.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The logic as for why \u9810\u304b\u308b is used by the industry is based on the concept of ownership (\u6240\u6709\u6a29) of the amount of money (\u91d1\u984d). Until the bill(s) are processed in the register (\u30ec\u30b8) and change is given back to the consumer, that money is still owned by the consumer and the establishment does view this as their way of holding onto the money until the transaction (\u6c7a\u6e08) is finalized. Once the change is given back, the ownership of said change has not changed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13a. 5600\u5186\u3061\u3087\u3046\u3069\u304a\u9810\u304b\u308a\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002X<br>13b. 5600\u5186\u3061\u3087\u3046\u3069\uff5b\u9802\u304d\u307e\u3059\u30fb\u9802\u6234\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059\uff5d\u3002\u25ce<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will be accepting exactly&nbsp;\u00a55,600 from you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the total is exact, more speakers do find the use of \u9810\u304b\u308b unnatural as the money is not being withheld. Some might argue, though, that if it takes a moment for the payment to process and for a receipt to be given, you are still withholding it for some time, but in general, using either \u9802\u304d\u307e\u3059 or \u9802\u6234\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059 in this situation would be most natural.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Change &amp; Tipping<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When your change is being given back to you, you will hear the following:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14a. \u3007\u3007\u5186\u306e\u304a\u8fd4\u3057\u3067\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u25ce<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14b. \u3007\u3007\u5186\u306e\u304a\u8fd4\u3057\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u25b3<br>Here is your change of&nbsp;\u00a5##.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that the use of \uff5e\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059 is too common not to ignore but that many speakers, especially those in their 30s and older, may still find it ungrammatical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, what if you need to ask for your change or if you want to tell the person you are in no need of change?
