The final particle was used heavily by both men and women up until the early 1900s, but as the century went on, \u304b\u3057\u3089 largely fell out of use, having always been overshadowed by \u304b\u306a, at least for when it means &#8220;I wonder&#8230;&#8221; In requests, it typically accompanies a giving verb such as \u304f\u308c\u308b, and in this context, it is largely associated with female speech, perhaps further implicated by the inherent rising intonation from being used in a question. In the wake of its decline, \u304b\u3057\u3089 became associated with \u3066\u308f\u30fb\u3060\u3088\u8a00\u8449\uff1d\u5973\u6027\u8a9e, and that association has persisted into the present. In modern times as gender-specific language itself is waning, \u304b\u3057\u3089 has once again taken a hit in how frequency it is used. In some dialects, however, it has remained as a typical variant of \uff5e\u304b\u77e5\u3089\u3093 from whence it came. <a href=\"#6836c3b9-d5ad-474c-aada-c26352011ac6-link\" aria-label=\"\u811a\u6ce8\u53c2\u71674\u306b\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\">\u21a9\ufe0e<\/a><\/li><li id=\"692f7e14-0885-4fa3-9e88-a7513d7b5b28\">\uff5e\u3088\u3046\u3058\u3083\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304b is a mixture of the casual contraction \u3067\u306f \u2192 \u3058\u3083 and polite speech.

This resulted in verb forms such as [myo:] before palatalization of the \u672a\u7136\u5f62 was reversed to bring about \uff5e\u3088\u3046. Sometimes, these palatalized fusions of the \u672a\u7136\u5f62 + \uff5e\u3046 can still be heard, especially in Western Japanese dialects.  \",\"id\":\"42c60767-fa31-47f2-8263-1300caa0ffea\"},{\"content\":\"Repeating a verb in its volitional form is not so childish in tone as the direct equivalent would be in English.\",\"id\":\"7a3064f4-4d5d-425d-a7da-062e5272d9ef\"},{\"content\":\"While \u304b\u3057\u3089 is often described as the feminine equivalent of \u304b\u306a, this, too, is dependent on nuance, dialect, intonation, and historical context. The final particle was used heavily by both men and women up until the early 1900s, but as the century went on, \u304b\u3057\u3089 largely fell out of use, having always been overshadowed by \u304b\u306a, at least for when it means \\\"I wonder...\\\" In requests, it typically accompanies a giving verb such as \u304f\u308c\u308b, and in this context, it is largely associated with female speech, perhaps further implicated by the inherent rising intonation from being used in a question. In the wake of its decline, \u304b\u3057\u3089 became associated with \u3066\u308f\u30fb\u3060\u3088\u8a00\u8449\uff1d\u5973\u6027\u8a9e, and that association has persisted into the present. In modern times as gender-specific language itself is waning, \u304b\u3057\u3089 has once again taken a hit in how frequency it is used. In some dialects, however, it has remained as a typical variant of \uff5e\u304b\u77e5\u3089\u3093 from whence it came.\",\"id\":\"6836c3b9-d5ad-474c-aada-c26352011ac6\"},{\"content\":\"\uff5e\u3088\u3046\u3058\u3083\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304b is a mixture of the casual contraction \u3067\u306f \u2192 \u3058\u3083 and polite speech.
