This would imply how 5 was originally monosyllabic as \u3044, but this also conflicts with how 50 oddly was also \u3044 as mentioned earlier with the surname \u4e94\u5341\u9234.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u203bThe pronunciations \u3082\u3082 and \u307b for 100, as mentioned above, share the same etymology. For 200-400, it appears that they were interchangeable, although there is actually no recorded instances of some multiples of 100 such as 300. However, given how native number use gets cut off today at 4 (treating \u3082\u3082 and \u307b as counters), this may have prevented the use of \u3082\u3082 for 400 and higher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u203bThe use of \uff5e\u3061\u30fb\u3062 beyond 100 is contested due to sheer lack of instances of numbers that high being used in the native number system. Proof to the unlikelihood of this can be found in the etymology of \u3088\u308d\u3065, which is thought to derive from&nbsp;or at least be cognate with the Korean word &#8220;yeoreo&#8221; meaning &#8220;various.&#8221; The \uff5e\u3065 would then be the counter \uff5e\u3064 and indicate that at one point, \uff5e\u3061\u30fb\u3062 might not have existed at all. Evidence of this can be found in \uff5e\u3064 attaching to&nbsp;large numbers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ex. \u4e94\u767e\u6d25\u771f\u8ce2\u6728&nbsp;\uff08\u3044\u307b\u3064\u307e\u3055\u304b\u304d\uff09<br>Lit. 500 (branched)&nbsp;true-sakaki (sacred trees)<br>Meaning: Native word for evergreen tree, holding religious significance in Shintoism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Orthography Note<\/strong>: \uff5e\u3061\u30fb\u3062 was given the Ateji spelling of \u8def. In Modern Japanese, this has caused the multiples of 10 to be misunderstood in the context of age as referring to the entire decade. Thus, \u4e09\u5341\u8def is often used to mean &#8220;one&#8217;s thirties,&#8221; but in Classical Japanese, it was understood to mean &#8220;age 30.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u203bOf course, Sino-Japanese numbers have always been paired with Sino-Japanese counters, and the array of such counters that exist today appear in Classical Japanese as well. What would differ would be their pronunciations due to systematic sound changes that have taken place over the centuries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Numbers in Between in the Native Number System&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating numbers in between powers of 10 beyond 10^1 is a murky situation in the native number system. Such means to create any number such as 11, 101, 393, etc. only came into being once speakers felt the system ought to just as productive as the Sino-Japanese system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once native numbers were being used more frequently at least in&nbsp;language devoid of Sino-Japanese vocabulary, speakers would use the native numbers for 1-10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 quite regularly when counting, as is indicated by a passage in the Tale of Genji:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u304a\u6307\uff08\u3088\u3073\uff09\u3092\u304b\u304c\u3081\u3066\u5341\uff08\u3068\u3092\uff09\u3001\u306f\u305f\u3001\u307f\u305d\u3001\u3088\u305d\u3001\u306a\u3069\u6570\u3075\u308b\u3055\u307e<br>(Her) counting with her&nbsp;fingers 10, 20, 30, 40, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Texts from these initial centuries after the influx of Sino-Japanese influence indicate just how speakers overcame the lack of native numbers in between these base numbers. The solution was the use of the word \u3042\u307e\u308a meaning &#8220;remainder.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the base unit&nbsp;with its counter, insert \u3042\u307e\u308a, then follow with the remaining part of the number along with the counter once more.

Before it would fade into history, however, attempts were made to simplify it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the Kamakura Period (12th century), word-medial counters had become simplified to \uff5e\u3061\u30fb\u3062. Thus, \u307f\u305d\u3068\u305b \u3042\u307e\u308a \u3044\u3064\u3068\u305b (35 years) would become \u307f\u305d\u3062 \u3042\u307e\u308a \u3044\u3064\u3068\u305b.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, by the Edo Period, \u3042\u307e\u308a became dropped entirely, but before it took its last breath, it had become common-place to drop all but the last instance. This would render numbers such as 99,999 as:<br><br>\u3053\u3053\u306e\u3088\u308d\u305a \u3053\u3053\u306e\u3061 \u3053\u3053\u306e\u307b \u3053\u3053\u306e\u305d\u3062 \u3042\u307e\u308a \u3053\u3053\u306e\u3064.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this example, instances of \uff5e\u3061 beyond 100 are presumed to have not occurred.<br><br>Into Early Modern Japanese, any semblance of the native system applied to numbers greater than 10 fundamentally lack \u3042\u307e\u308a. The greatest example of this is \u4e09\u5341\u4e00\u6587\u5b57, which reads as \u307f\u305d\u3072\u3068\u3082\u3058, referring to the number of letters in a tanka poem.

For instance, the 30th could be referred to as \u3064\u3054\u3082\u308a.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, to refer to the 11-19th, you could use the pattern &#8220;\u306a\u304b\u306e + # + day counter&#8221; instead. Thus, the 15th could be referred to as \u306a\u304b\u306e\u3044\u3064\u304b instead of by the longer \u3068\u3092\u304b\u3042\u307e\u308a\u3044\u3064\u304b. Similarly, the 21st-29th could be referred to as &#8220;\u3042\u3068\u306e + # + day counter.&#8221; Thus, the 21st could be referred to as&nbsp;\u3042\u3068\u306e\u3064\u3044\u305f\u3061 instead of by the longer \u306f\u3064\u304b\u3042\u307e\u308a\u3072\u3068\u3072.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Counter \uff5e\u305f\u308a\u30fb\u308a with Native Numbers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another crucial counter used with native numbers is the counter for people, which manifests as \uff5e\u305f\u308a for most numbers except with 1 and 2 in which it is seen as \uff5e\u308a.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>\u3072\u3068\u308a<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>\u3075\u305f\u308a<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u307f\u305f\u308a<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3088\u305f\u308a<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3044\u3064\u305f\u308a<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>\u3080\u305f\u308a<\/td><td>7&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u306a\u306a\u305f\u308a<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3084\u305f\u308a<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>\u3053\u3053\u306e\u305f\u308a<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3068\u305f\u308a<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Example Sentences<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u307e\u305f\u3001\u6cbb\u627f\uff08\u3062\u3057\u3088\u3046\uff09\u56db\u5e74\uff08\u3088\u3068\u305b\uff09\u6c34\u7121\u6708\uff08\u307f\u306a\u3065\u304d\uff09\u306e\u3053\u308d\u3001\u306b\u306f\u304b\u306b\u90fd\uff08\u307f\u3084\u3053\uff09\u9077\u308a\u306f\u3079\u308a\u304d\u3002<br>Again, around the sixth month and fourth year of the Jishou Era, there was a sudden capital move.<br>From the \u65b9\u4e08\u8a18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u304a\u307b\u304b\u305f\u3001\u3053\u306e\u4eac\u306e\u521d\u3081\u3092\u805e\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u3001\u5d6f\u5ce8\u306e\u5929\u7687\uff08\u3066\u3093\u308f\u3046\uff09\u306e\u5fa1\u6642\u3001\u90fd\u3068\u5b9a\u307e\u308a\u306b\u3051\u308b\u3088\u308a\u5f8c\u3001\u3059\u3067\u306b\u56db\u767e\uff08\u3057\u3072\u3083\u304f\uff09\u4f59\u6b73\u3092\u7d4c\u305f\u308a\u3002<br>To begin with, as for hearing about the rise of Heiankyou, it has already been four hundred years since the capital was determined in the reign of Emperor Saga.<br>From the \u65b9\u4e08\u8a18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;\u5341\u4e00\u65e5\uff08\u3058\u3075\u3044\u3061\u306b\u3061\uff09\u306e\u6708\u3082\u304b\u304f\u308c\u306a\u3080\u3068\u3059\u308c\u3070<br>When the moon of the eleventh day was about to disappear<br>From the \u4f0a\u52e2\u7269\u8a9e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4.&nbsp;\u516b\u96f2\uff08\u3084\u304f\u3082\uff09<br>Eight\/a lot of clouds<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. \u540c\u3058\u304d\u4e03\u65e5\uff08\u306a\u306c\u304b\u306e\u3072\uff09<br>On the same seventh day of the month<br>From the \u5e73\u5bb6\u7269\u8a9e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.<br>\u4e07\u8449\u4eee\u540d: \u4e00\u574f\u4e43 \u6fc1\u9152\u4e4e \u53ef\u98f2\u6709\u826f\u5e2b<br>\u6f22\u5b57\u304b\u306a: \u4e00\u676f\uff08\u3072\u3068\u3064\u304d\uff09\u306e\u6fc1\u308c\u308b\u9152\u3092\u98f2\u3080\u3079\u304f\u3042\u308b\u3089\u3057\u3002<br>It seems better to drink a cup of cloudy sake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the \u4e07\u8449\u96c6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. \u4e8c\u4eba\u3057\u3066\u6253\u305f\u3093\u306b\u306f\u3001\u4f8d\uff08\u306f\u3079\uff09\u308a\u306a\u3080\u3084\u3002<br>If two people hit (the dog), would it still live?<br>From the \u6795\u8349\u5b50.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. \u516d\u65e5\uff08\u3080\u3086\u304b\uff09\u3001\u304d\u306e\u3075\u306e\u3054\u3068\u3057\u3002<br>The sixth.
