This category pertains to the insertion of \u3063(\u4fc3\u97f3\u6dfb\u52a0) or the transformation of a mora to \u3063 (\u4fc3\u97f3\u4fbf), and the category as a whole may be referred to as \u4fc3\u97f3\u5316. <br><br>The phonetic value of \u3063 is referred to as a moraic obstruent which manifests as gemination of the following consonant, and as we know, it constitutes itself as a contrastive phoneme in Japanese, creating countless minimal pairs &#8211; ex. \u5207\u624b (stamp) vs. \u6765\u3066 (\u3066-form of &#8220;to come&#8221;).<br><br>Both types of phenomena involving \u3063 are attest to compound word formation and\/or contractions in conjugation.

While it may seem tempting to assume that \u30bb\u30ad is changed to \u30bb\u30c3 in compounds, the sound change at play is actually directed in the opposite direction. All of these ON readings would have followed a CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) syllabic format in their source language. As Japanese does not allow consonant-final syllables, the high vowels &#8211; \/i\/ or \/u\/<sup data-fn=\"29d7a58a-acd9-484f-b28d-70483273b530\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#29d7a58a-acd9-484f-b28d-70483273b530\" id=\"29d7a58a-acd9-484f-b28d-70483273b530-link\">4<\/a><\/sup> &#8211; are added to assimilate those readings into Japanese. Yet, perhaps due to it being easier for Japanese speakers at the time to mimic, these final consonants were preserved in compounds. The final consonants preserved in this way were \u00a0[p\u031a],\u00a0[t\u031a],\u00a0and [k\u031a], which as indicated by the IPA notation, were accurately pronounced as applosives (unreleased plosives\/stops). <br><br>The Kana syllabaries were insufficient to spell these applosives, as each Kana only corresponded to either V or CV, and the appearance of \u3064 was highly inconsistent until modernity. Yet, the existence of the resulting consonant gemination remained evident. As for how that was true, consider words like \u7bc0\u53e5<sup data-fn=\"f6b36b3d-31e5-4c2c-817d-c61b24a617f1\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#f6b36b3d-31e5-4c2c-817d-c61b24a617f1\" id=\"f6b36b3d-31e5-4c2c-817d-c61b24a617f1-link\">5<\/a><\/sup> (seasonal festival) which were spelled in Kana as \u305b\u304f without any indication of this gemination. For many centuries, the only instances in which this gemination was more explicitly denoted was through tone markings inherited from the characters&#8217; borrowing from Chinese. These final consonants were known as being in syllables with a checked tone (\u5165\u58f0), and whenever a syllable was marked with this, it was understood that no intervening vowel would be imposed on the first syllable and that there would be a rise in the second syllable accompanied with the gemination of the initial consonant of said second syllable. <br><br>The greatest headache to knowing when to expect \u3063 is not as simple as knowing to assume that \/i\/ and \/u\/ were not initially present upon entering the language, as words like \u77f3\u70ad (coal), which is read as \u305b\u304d\u305f\u3093 as opposed to \u305b\u3063\u305f\u3093, appear to violate the norm established above. The key here is to return back to the added condition that the second syllable be of the same articulation as the final consonant of the first syllable, making \u77f3\u70ad no exception at all &#8211; [k\u031a] is velar while \/t\/ is alveolar. <br><br>For applosive [-t\u031a] in these Sino-Japanese compounds, this means that \u3063 would appear when the following consonant was either \/t\/ or \/s\/, as both consonants are alveolar. Though the example words below happen to all be examples of Japanese-coined Sino-Japanese vocabulary during the Meiji Restoration, their original approximate ON readings compared to their modern readings still represent how sound changes those Kanji have undergone. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table aligncenter\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Word<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Original Approx.<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">Modern Reading<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u4fc3\u97f3\u5316<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u767a\u4fe1 (dispatch)<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\/*pat\u031a-\/ + \/*\u0283in\/<sup data-fn=\"b940bb8d-1f39-47e9-af29-7fceac0c8e5c\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#b940bb8d-1f39-47e9-af29-7fceac0c8e5c\" id=\"b940bb8d-1f39-47e9-af29-7fceac0c8e5c-link\">6<\/a><\/sup><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u306f\u3063\u3057\u3093<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u3007<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u767a\u9054 (development)<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\/*pat\u031a-\/ + \/*tat\/<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u306f\u3063\u305f\u3064<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u3007<\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u767a\u660e (invention)<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\/*pat\u031a-\/ + \/*me\u014b\/<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">\u306f\u3064\u3081\u3044<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\">X<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for applosive \/-p\u031a\/, due to the loss of \/p\/ as a phoneme<sup data-fn=\"3ef61c7a-f61a-4c4e-932b-d8147a697e4d\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#3ef61c7a-f61a-4c4e-932b-d8147a697e4d\" id=\"3ef61c7a-f61a-4c4e-932b-d8147a697e4d-link\">7<\/a><\/sup>, things seem a little tricky because of modern Kana spelling reform (\u73fe\u4ee3\u4eee\u540d\u9063\u3044) and how other sound changes have taken place in tandem.

This sometimes creates a rift between word pairs, which can be seen between \u7a81\u304d\u5207\u308b and \u7a81\u3063\u5207\u308b. While \u7a81\u3063\u5207\u308b means &#8220;to cut across,&#8221; with the nucleus of the phrase being \u5207\u308b, \u7a81\u304d\u5207\u308b means &#8220;to  completely stab\/push\/strike through,&#8221; with the nucleus being \u7a81\u304f and \u5207\u308b being a supplementary verb. Determining whether V<sub>1<\/sub> is in fact an adverbial prefix or contributing to the compound as a fully functional verb requires analyzing the phrase as a whole, and at times, context along with it. <br>\u203b\u6253\u3064 is a polysemous word, meaning it has many meanings which are all interrelated with each other, but understanding its core meaning &#8211; &#8220;to hit&#8221; &#8211; enables one to figure out said network. As far as \u6253\u3061\uff5e is concerned, it has been a very productive prefix with several meanings since Classical Japanese. While it is rather rare for \u4fc3\u97f3\u5316 to occur, \u3046\u3063\u3061\u3083\u308b may be found in various dialects with the meaning of &#8220;to discard\/throw away,&#8221; which is based on the original meaning of the compound, &#8220;to neglect\/let be.&#8221; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also examples of \u3057 in \u9023\u7528\u5f62 undergoing \u4fc3\u97f3\u5316, which is a general feature of Eastern Japanese dialects.

Often times, a single onomatopoeia may have various iterations, and this variation is very systematic. Consider the onomatopoeia \u3074\u304b\u3063\uff08\u3068\uff09\u30fb\u3074\u304b\u3074\u304b\uff08\u3068\uff09 which indicates shining\/glimmering. One form clearly utilizes \u3063 while the other form utilizes duplication of the core sound effect. <br><br>The first observation that can be made is that the appearance of \u3063\u30fb\u30c3 at the end of a morpheme directly violates a norm established throughout the Japanese lexicon, that being syllables\/morae not end in a stop &#8211; when \u3063\u30fb\u30c3 is isolated, it is realized as a glottal stop. Yet, this is often viewed as a defining phonological characteristic of onomatopoeia as a word group. <br><br>As for the nuancing \u3063\u30fb\u30c3 provides in onomatopoeia, expressions can be grouped most accurately into two categories. <br><br>\u30fbGroup 1: Onomatopoeia in which \u3063\u30fb\u30c3 may be viewed as an intensifying agent.<br>\u30fbGroup 2: Onomatopoeia in which \u3063\u30fb\u30c3 is intrinsic to the root and cannot be (definitively) identified as an intensifying agent. <br><br>Onomatopoeia in Group 1 are indicative of \u4fc3\u97f3\u5316, which we have already seen with \u3074\u305f\u308a vs \u3074\u3063\u305f\u308a. Onomatopoeia in Group 2 such as \u3074\u304b\u3063 are more numerous and representative of onomatopoeia as a whole, but because of all the variation &#8211; though systematic &#8211; that is present in group, we will focus solely on the appearance of \u3063\u30fb\u30c3  in this group. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u3063\u30fb\u30c3 = Suddenness? <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned, Group 2 is defined as \u3063\u30fb\u30c3 not inherently intensifying the expression, and as a consequence should not necessarily be viewed as playing a semantic role.

Here, we see that when \u3068\u30fb\u3063\u3066 surpass the &#8220;four mora&#8221; limit of an onomatopoeia, it sounds all the more like its citation function. <br><br>6. \u7a93\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u304c\u30ac\u30bf\u30ac\u30bf\uff5b\u3063\u3066\u30fb\u3068\u30fb\u3063\u3068\uff5d\u9cf4\u3063\u305f\u3002<br>The window glass made this &#8220;wobbling&#8221;
