Now, if the source were omitted, both bits of information need not be or felt to be hearsay so much so as they would be objective yet not 100% vetted statements.<br><br>As for Ex. 5, the speaker is more involved and feels compelled to get the word out about the typhoon approaching Tokyo. Now, because the second sentence sounds more like a direct quote, using a means of quotation would be most natural than repeating the use of \uff5e\u305d\u3046\u3060. Although not wrong, repeating \uff5e\u305d\u3046\u3060 does not add clarity to the state of mind of the speaker or the statement itself, as both hearsay comments could have been said as one statement then followed by the visual observation.

By using \uff5e\u3089\u3057\u3044 instead in the second sentence, we as the listeners can deduce that the typhoon hitting Tokyo is the conclusion that the speaker made from both what the speaker gathered from the news report and from what is happening outside, whereas \uff5e\u305d\u3046\u3060 can only clue us into the trajectory being what they heard about.<br><br>6. \u304d\u306e\u3046\u5730\u9707\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u305d\u3046\u3060\u3002<br>I heard there was an earthquake yesterday.<br><br>7. \u304d\u306e\u3046\u5730\u9707\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3089\u3057\u3044\u3002<br>There was apparently an earthquake yesterday.<br><br>8. \u304d\u306e\u3046\u5730\u9707\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3088\u3046\u3060\u3002<br>It looks like there was an earthquake.<br><br>In Ex. 6, the speaker was nowhere near the earthquake. They could have seen and\/or heard the damage on the news, but they themselves could not have been witness to it. In Ex. 7, however, the speaker has seen\/heard evidence to suggest that an earthquake occurred for themselves. Further context could aid in telling whether comments from the neighborhood &#8211; a.k.a hearsay &#8211; helped lead the speaker to that conclusion, but what is certain is that the speaker is making a fairly objective observation. Because the sentence is in the past tense, though, it would be unfair to conclude that the speaker is indifferent to the situation with the earthquake already having taken place. Ex. 8, meanwhile, does not indicate hearsay, only the observation that it looks like an earthquake might have occurred.<br><br>The sentences shown so far do indeed show that there is interchangeability between \uff5e\u3089\u3057\u3044 and \uff5e\u305d\u3046\u3060, but the impression given will be different, sometimes majorly, and it will be that change in perspective that, if harnessed, will enable you to distinguish them in your own speech.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Example Sentences<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>9. \u300c\u3042\u308c\u3001\u7530\u4e2d\u5148\u751f\u306f\uff1f\u300d\u300c\u3042\u3001\u304d\u306e\u3046\u5165\u9662\u3057\u305f\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3088\u300d<br>&#8220;Huh, (where is) Tanaka Sensei?&#8221; &#8220;Ah, (s)he was hospitalized yesterday, I heard.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10. \u5ef6\u671f\u306e\u7406\u7531\u306f\u8a73\u7d30\u4e0d\u660e\u306e\u75c5\u6c17\u3060\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>(People) are saying that the reason for the postponing was (the person in question) was ill with an undisclosed illness. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11. \u5642\u306b\u3088\u308c\u3070\u3001\u4e8c\u4eba\u306f\u96e2\u5a5a\u3059\u308b\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>Rumor has it that the two are getting a divorce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12. \u7f85\u751f\u9580\u306f\u3044\u3044\u6620\u753b\u3060\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>They say that Rashomon is a good movie.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Culture Note<\/strong>: \u7f85\u751f\u9580 is a very popular crime scene movie in Japan from the 1950s created by the renowned producer \u9ed2\u6fa4\u660e.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13. \u30b7\u30f3\u30ac\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u5730\u9707\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u305d\u3046\u3060\u3002<br>I heard that there was an earthquake in Singapore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14. \u5929\u6c17\u4e88\u5831\u3067\u306f\u4eca\u65e5\u306f\u96e8\u304c\u964d\u3089\u306a\u3044\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>I heard it&#8217;s not going to rain today from the weather report.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>15. \u30b1\u30a4\u30c8\u3055\u3093\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u304c\u3042\u307e\u308a\u4e0a\u624b\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u305d\u308c\u306f\u672c\u5f53\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\u3002<br>I hear that Kate isn&#8217;t that good at Japanese, but is that really true?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>16. \u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30d5\u3082\u82f1\u8a9e\u529b\u304c\u920d\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3088\u3046\u306b\u52c9\u5f37\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>I hear that even the staff studies so that their English doesn&#8217;t get rusty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>17. \u300c\u3042\u306e\u4eba\u306f\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u3082\u306e\u306f\u4f55\u3067\u3082\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u3084\u308b\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3088\u300d\u300c\u3088\u3063\u307d\u3069\u7518\u3084\u304b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u300d<br>&#8220;I hear that person always buys whatever her kids want.&#8221; &#8220;(They) must really be spoiling (the kid), huh.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>18.&nbsp; \u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u5c40\u304c\u6765\u6708\u304b\u3089\u30bf\u30ac\u30ed\u30b0\u8a9e\u306e\u756a\u7d44\u3092\u653e\u9001\u3059\u308b\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002<br>I hear that the TV network will air a Tagalog program starting next month.<\/p>\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-footnotes\"><li id=\"6a238fa8-c5e0-4d2d-9c37-9bfb13dbd67c\">Ultimately, Function 2 is just an offshoot of Function 1, made possible by \uff5e\u305d\u3046\u3060&#8217;s overall ability to show how something seems to be.
