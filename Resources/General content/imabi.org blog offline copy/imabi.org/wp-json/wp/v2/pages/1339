Although all three of these particles are very similar to what they are in Modern Japanese, there are quite a few things that make a big difference. For example, where&#8217;s \u3067? It evolves from \u306b\u3066. So, way back when, \u306b showed all of the functions now allotted to just \u3067!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u306b<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just as in Modern Japanese, \u306b has a lot of usages!

It can be used like the particles \u3067 and \u306b\u3066 to show the location of an action. It may also show method by which something is done as well as cause. All of these usages have been given to \u3067 in Modern Japanese. In Modern Japanese you would be counted wrong for this. However, for a very long time up until and even a whiles after the contraction of \u306b\u3066 to \u3067 was made, \u306b was still used in this way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u3053\u306e<ruby>\u76ae\u8863<rt>\u304b\u306f\u304e\u306c<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306f\u3001\u706b\u306b\u713c\u304b\u3080\u306b\u713c\u3051\u305a\u306f\u3053\u305d\u3001<ruby>\u771f<rt>\u307e\u3053\u3068<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306a\u3089\u3081\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; When we try to burn this leather robe with fire and it doesn&#8217;t burn, then it&#8217;s probably the real thing.<br>From the \u7af9\u53d6\u7269\u8a9e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Particle Note<\/strong>: Remember the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62\u306e\u6e96\u4f53\u6cd5?

The conjunctive particle \u306b is interchangeable with the conjunctive particle \u3092. As we learned in that lesson, this \u306b can be used to show causation, concession, as well as sequence.
