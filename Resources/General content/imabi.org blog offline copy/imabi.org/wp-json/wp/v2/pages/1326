There are two main sources of vocabulary in Classical Japanese: Sino-Japanese words (\u6f22\u8a9e) and native Japanese words (\u5927\u548c\u8a00\u8449). Native words are much more common, and it is only as time progresses that Sino-Japanese words begin to make a big chunk of the lexicon. With this being the case, the further in time you go back, the more likely you will encounter older native words that have since been replaced with Sino-Japanese vocabulary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nouns\u3000\u4e0a\u4ee3\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u540d\u8a5e<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are four kinds of nouns in Classical Japanese grammar: proper, common, numerical, and nominal (dummy) nouns. Their functions can be described as follows in the same order with their Japanese terminology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>\u56fa\u6709\u540d\u8a5e<\/td><td>&nbsp; The names of people, groups, and\/or places.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u666e\u901a\u540d\u8a5e<\/td><td>&nbsp; Words that represent generic names of people, places, things, ideas, etc.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u6570\u540d\u8a5e<\/td><td>&nbsp;Words that express number: numbers themselves or counter phrases.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u5f62\u5f0f\u540d\u8a5e<\/td><td>&nbsp;Nouns which carry grammatical functions that have lost whatever literal meaning they may have once had.

However, competent knowledge of Kanji spellings in modern writing can at least help you identify what the words mean if you are still getting used to traditional orthography.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we will be learning about numerical and nominal nouns separately in future lessons, the following chart will introduce a handful of proper and common nouns with their original readings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><td><strong>\u8a9e\u5f59<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;\u8aad\u307f<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>&nbsp;\u82f1\u8a33<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\u6545<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3086\u3091<\/td><td>&nbsp;Reason<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u7121\u5e38<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3080\u3058\u3084\u3046<\/td><td>&nbsp;Impermanence<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u4e09\u7b20\u306e\u5c71<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u307f\u304b\u3055\u306e\u3084\u307e<\/td><td>&nbsp;Mt.
