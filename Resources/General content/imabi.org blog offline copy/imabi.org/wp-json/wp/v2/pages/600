The unusual way it connects to adjective\/verb expressions, not properly understanding what can follow them, and not understanding formality differences are the main sources of error. The lesson will be ended with the similar \uff5e\u306b\u6c7a\u307e\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\uff5e\u306b\u9055\u3044\u306a\u3044 VS\u3000\uff5e\u306b\u76f8\u9055\u306a\u3044<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, these expressions are both translated as \u201cthere is without a doubt that\u2026\u201d. This is the immediate source of confusion because you can add phrases like \u201cI think that\u201d or \u201cprobably\u201d in English without causing ungrammaticality. However, with these Japanese expressions, doing so does. First, consider the following defining of these terms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\uff5e\u306b\u9055\u3044\u306a\u3044<\/strong>: Not from objective proof or logical speculation, but rather from the speaker\u2019s own experience, this phrase shows one\u2019s intuitive speculation\/confidence. With such a bold move, it is without surprise that this is quite strong. It is often used in situations where it&#8217;s as if one is talking to oneself in attempts to verify one\u2019s own guess or deliberation. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\uff5e\u306b\u76f8\u9055\u306a\u3044<\/strong>: Like \uff5e\u306b\u9055\u3044\u306a\u3044, it shows intuitive speculation\/confidence, but it is more stiff and formal. This formality difference is very important to keep in mind. One reason is that speech modals more akin to the spoken language like the final particle \u304b\u3089, which is commonly used with \uff5e\u306b\u9055\u3044\u306a\u3044, are not typically used with \uff5e\u76f8\u9055\u306a\u3044. This also implies that there is no mistake in it; thus, it gives a more confident tone. Thus, although adverbs like \u304d\u3063\u3068 are common with \uff5e\u306b\u9055\u3044\u306a\u3044, it is not with \uff5e\u306b\u76f8\u9055\u306a\u3044 due to the tone. Although perhaps of old logic, some speakers feel this is more so indicative of middle-aged\/old men as they are more likely to use old-fashioned expressions, which would not be old-fashioned for them, and fits the traditional tone for masculine speech.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These patterns attach to phrases in the following manner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;Nouns<\/td><td>&nbsp;N\uff08\u3067\u3042\u308b\uff09\uff0b\uff5e\u306b\uff5b\u9055\u3044\u30fb\u76f8\u9055\uff5d\u306a\u3044<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e \uff0b \uff5e\u306b\uff5b\u9055\u3044\u30fb\u76f8\u9055\uff5d\u306a\u3044<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e\uff08\u3067\u3042\u308b\uff09 \uff0b \uff5e\u306b\uff5b\u9055\u3044\u30fb\u76f8\u9055\uff5d\u306a\u3044<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;Verbs<\/td><td>&nbsp;Verb \uff0b \uff5e\u306b\uff5b\u9055\u3044\u30fb\u76f8\u9055\uff5d\u306a\u3044<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice that it does not say Adj\/V \uff0b \u3053\u3068 \uff0b \u306b\uff5b\u9055\u3044\u30fb\u76f8\u9055\uff5d\u306a\u3044. It is a set phrase, and like other phrases with \u306b, the reason for why this is allowed stems from a Classical Japanese grammatical maneuver of using conjugational parts of speech as nominal phrases when in the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62. As this base has changed appearance for many items, it&#8217;s not surprising that in Modern Japanese this technique is limited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>Examples<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u653f\u5e9c\u306e\u5831\u9053\u5b98\u306e\u5fdc\u7b54\u306f\u3069\u3093\u306a\u306b\uff08\u304b\uff09\u6094\u3057\u304b\u3063\u305f\u306b\u9055\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The response of the government spokesperson was in no doubt overly regrettable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: In a more literary sense \u3069\u3093\u306a\u306b\uff08\u304b\uff09 may be replaced with \u3044\u304b\u3070\u304b\u308a\u304b.
