To truly understand how this pattern works regarding nuance, though, let&#8217;s posit that the first clause is X and the second clause is Y. In the mind of the speaker, X is mentioned first as it has the highest relevance or the highest recognition of being obvious, whereas Y adds to what is obvious or fully expected given knowledge of the situation. Y may at times be far more impressive than Y, but the reason why X is mentioned first is because it has the most relevance.<br><br><strong>Speech Style Note<\/strong>: While \uff5e\u306f\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093 is largely used in the written language, whenever it is utilized in the spoken language, it is often rendered as \uff5e\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093\u306e\u3053\u3068, which grammatically allows for said dependent clause to more clearly function as a noun-predicate that is more parallel in structure to predicate Y. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>20. \u5f7c\u306f\u82f1\u8a9e\u306f\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093\u3001\u30b9\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u8a9e\u3082\u97d3\u56fd\u8a9e\u3082\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>Not to mention English, he can also speak Spanish and Korean.<br><br>21 \u3042\u306e\u5b50\u306f\u66f8\u304f\u306e\u306f\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093\u3001\u8aad\u3080\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>That kid can&#8217;t even read, let alone write.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>22. \u5f7c\u306f\u3001\u6bcd\u8a9e\u306f\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093\uff08\u306e\u3053\u3068\uff09\u3001\u4ed6\u306b\u30827\u3064\u306e\u8a00\u8a9e\u3082\u8a71\u305b\u307e\u3059\u3088\u3002<br>Not only his native language, but he can also speak seven other languages.<br><br>23. \u5f7c\u306f\u4fee\u58eb\u3092\u5f97\u308b\u306e\u306f\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093\u3001\u5165\u5b66\u3055\u3048\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3002<br>He can&#8217;t even enter college, let alone receive a master&#8217;s degree.<br><br>Now, whenever Y is not something that cannot be deemed obvious given the situation at hand, \uff5e\u306f\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093 becomes ungrammatical, and it would need to be replaced with something broader such as \uff5e\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306a\u304f.<br><br>24. \u3053\u306e\u7c73\u306b\u306f\u3001\u3082\u307f\uff5b\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306a\u304f \u307e\u308b\u30fb\u306f\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093 X\uff5d\u3001\u7802\u307e\u3067\u5165\u3063\u3066\u308b\u306e\u3088\u3002<br>Not only is there husks in this rice, there&#8217;s even sand in it. <br><br>While it may be intrinsically obvious that someone who excels in his main language does indeed have mastery in other languages like in Ex. 22, there is nothing intrinsic about rice being contaminated with all sorts of things. <br><br>\uff5e\u306f\u3082\u3068\u3088\u308a<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nuance spin that \uff5e\u306f\u3082\u3068\u3088\u308a provides is that it quality X is &#8220;principally&#8221; so.
