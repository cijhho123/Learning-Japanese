This is not the case in Japanese. Instead, the basic verb for &#8220;to wear&#8221; differs depending on the object, and to make things even more complicated, considerable overlap with varying nuance implications.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To&nbsp;tackle learning how to say&nbsp;&#8220;wearing&#8221; and &#8220;taking off,&#8221; we will first learn the various words for &#8220;clothing.&#8221; Then, we will go over the&nbsp;verbs that mean &#8220;to wear&#8221; and &#8220;to take off,&#8221; and in doing so, any item mentioned as being used with is introduced to you in Japanese at that point as opposed to giving you a list of clothing items without knowing what verb goes with them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lesson Note<\/strong>: Some of the verbs mentioned in this lesson may have other meanings which do not pertain to wearing things, but those will be left for future discovery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Word Note<\/strong>: \u7740\u8131, as you may have noticed in the title, is a convenient word for referring to both putting on and removing clothing together.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clothing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are roughly 10 important interrelated words which translate to &#8220;clothing.&#8221;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>\u670d: This is the most basic word for &#8220;clothes,&#8221; but it heavily refers to Western-style clothing.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u6d0b\u670d: More specifically, this is the word for Western clothes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u548c\u670d: This refers to traditional Japanese clothing such as kimono (\u7740\u7269), yukata&nbsp;(\u6d74\u8863), hakama&nbsp;(\u88b4), etc.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u8863\u670d: This is the formal word for &#8220;clothing&#8221; and largely refers to what can be seen outwardly like shirts, pants, etc.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u8863\u985e: This word largely refers to garments touching the body, including things like socks, underwear\/underclothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u7740\u7269: Traditionally, this means &#8220;clothing&#8221; in the most literal sense possible, but whenever there is a need to distinguish Western and Japanese clothing, it takes on the latter meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u670d\u88c5: This word means is the generic word for &#8220;attire.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u8863\u88c5\u30fb\u8863\u88f3: This word is akin to &#8220;outfit\/garment\/attire&#8221; for particular occasions.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u88c5\u675f: This is synonymous with \u8863\u88c5 but tends to be used in reference to older, traditional Japanese garments.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u8863: The KUN reading of this Kanji, \u3053\u308d\u3082, does indeed mean &#8220;clothing,&#8221; but it tends to be used in set phrases and literary language or refer primarily to monk attire (\u50e7\u8863\u30fb\u305d\u3046\u3048).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u304a\u53ec\u3057\u7269 is an honorific phrase used to refer to the clothing of others.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u8863\u6599\uff08\u54c1\uff09: If you go to a&nbsp;clothing department in Japan, you will encounter this word as it encompasses clothing, accessories, as well as materials to make clothing.
