For those that have excelled in controlling the inflectional parts of speech in Modern Japanese, there will be a lot of initial struggle in getting used to Classical Japanese conjugation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most obvious differences about verbs in Classical Japanese is that there are more verbal classes than there are in Modern Japanese. In Modern Japanese there are&nbsp;\u4e0a\u4e00\u6bb5, \u4e0b\u4e00\u6bb5, \u4e94\u6bb5, \u30b5\u5909, and \u30ab\u5909 verbs. In Classical Japanese there are \u4e0a\u4e00\u6bb5, \u4e0b\u4e00\u6bb5, \u4e0a\u4e8c\u6bb5, \u4e0b\u4e8c\u6bb5, \u56db\u6bb5, \u30b5\u5909, \u30ab\u5909, \u30e9\u5909, and \u30ca\u5909 verbs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; These verbal classes all differ in how their bases look and in the frequency that they appear. Later, we will learn how these 9 verbal classes condensed to the 5 that exist today. For the mean time, we will begin coverage of Classical Japanese verbs with the \u56db\u6bb5 class, the predecessor of the modern \u4e94\u6bb5 class.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; We are looking at the Japanese language over a period of 1000+ years. It would be anachronistic if not completely wrong to assume verbs never changed classes. For now, it is up to you to learn how to identify the class of a verb, conjugate any given verb into its bases, and recognize the modern equivalent of a given verb that you have. The material will be given to you in order to figure this out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u56db\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528\u52d5\u8a5e<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u56db\u6bb5 verbs are the most common kind of verbs in Classical Japanese, and it is still so today. \u56db\u6bb5 verbs are called such because they have a four-grade conjugation. Meaning, they have four different vowel grades. In other words, out of the six bases, at least one of them ends with one of four vowels. These four vowels, in other of the bases, are a, i, u, u, e, and e. Below are the bases for \u56db\u6bb5 verbs with the verb \u9022\u3075.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;\u672a\u7136\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9023\u7528\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7d42\u6b62\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9023\u4f53\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5df2\u7136\u5f62<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u547d\u4ee4\u5f62<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u9022\u306f<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9022\u3072<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9022\u3075<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9022\u3075<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9022\u3078<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u9022\u3078<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;<ruby>\u6b66\u8535<rt>\u3080\u3055\u3057<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e<ruby>\u570b<rt>\u304f\u306b<\/rt><\/ruby>\u307e\u3067<ruby>\u60d1<rt>\u307e\u3069<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3072\u6b69\u304d\u3051\u308a\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; He walked and wandered about as far as Musashi Province.<br>From the \u4f0a\u52e2\u7269\u8a9e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: \uff5e\u3051\u308a shows recollection.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. \u3051\u3075\u306f<ruby>\u90fd<rt>\u307f\u3084\u3053<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e\u307f\u305e\u601d\u3072\u3084\u3089\u308b\u308b\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I found myself turning my thoughts to just the capital today.&nbsp;<br>From the \u571f\u4f50\u65e5\u8a18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Notes<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. \u305e is used in Classical Japanese as a bound particle where it is very emphatic.<br>2. \uff5e\u308b\u308b is the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 of the auxiliary verb \uff5e\u308b, the predecessor of the Modern Japanese \uff5e\u308c\u308b.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u98a8\u3082\u5439\u304d\u306c\u3079\u3057\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The wind will also blow for sure.<br>From the \u571f\u4f50\u65e5\u8a18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: \uff5e\u306c is similar to &#8220;end up&#8221; and is used frequently with \uff5e\u3079\u3057 (should).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u590f\u306f<ruby>\u90ed\u516c<\/ruby>\u3092\u805e\u304f\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I listen to the cuckoo in the summer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.&nbsp;<ruby>\u6c5d<rt>\u306a\u3093\u3062<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3001\u3088\u304f\u805e\u3051\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Listen well you\uff01<br>From the \u4eca\u6614\u7269\u8a9e\u96c6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. \u6211\u306f\u3001\u3055\u3084\u306f\u601d\u3075\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Do I think that way?<br>From the \u5f92\u7136\u8349.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: \u3055 is like \u305d\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b in Modern Japanese and \u3084 is used here to make an emphatic rhetorical question.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. \u4eca<ruby>\u4e00\u5ea6<rt>\u3072\u3068\u305f\u3073<\/rt><\/ruby><ruby>\u8072<rt>\u3053\u3091<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3092\u3060\u306b\u805e\u304b\u305b\u7d66\u3078\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No, let me hear your voice at least one time.<br>From the \u6e90\u6c0f\u7269\u8a9e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. \u9cf4\u304f\u9e7f\u306e\u8072\u805e\u304f\u6642\u305e\u79cb\u306f\u304b\u306a\u3057\u304d\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh when I hear the voice of the crying deer, autumn is just sad!<br>From the \u53e4\u4eca\u548c\u6b4c\u96c6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammar Note<\/strong>: The \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 may end a sentence instead of the \u7d42\u6b62\u5f62 for emphasis.
