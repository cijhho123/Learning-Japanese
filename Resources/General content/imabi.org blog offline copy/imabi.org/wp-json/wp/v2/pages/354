Unlike in English in which its use is frowned upon in formal writing, the passive form in Japanese is both common written and spoken, but it does have its own quirks to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what is the passive voice? Suppose you&#8217;re on a beach and you see a cute little turtle and, all of a sudden, it gets swooped up and eaten by a seagull. As sad as this is, being &#8220;eaten&#8221; is an example of passivization. In Japanese, you don&#8217;t have to learn tons of different forms for all sorts of verbs to express the passive voice like in English, but there are some peculiarities that have to be noted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are only two passive endings in Japanese:&nbsp;\uff5e\u3089\u308c\u308b and \uff5e\u308c\u308b. There is no difference in meaning between the two, and the choice between the two is based on the class of verb. With that being said, before we delve into semantics, let&#8217;s learn the conjugations first.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\uff5e\u3089\u308c\u308b and \uff5e\u308c\u308b<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\uff5e\u3089\u308c\u308b attaches to \u4e00\u6bb5 (ru-verbs) and \uff5e\u308c\u308b attaches to \u4e94\u6bb5 (u-verbs). We then have the exceptional verbs \u3059\u308b and \u6765\u308b, which use these endings but are deemed irregular because the vowel in their stems changes when turned passive.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular Verbs&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;Plain (ru)<\/td><td>&nbsp;Passive (ru)<\/td><td>&nbsp;Plain (u)<\/td><td>&nbsp;Passive (u)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u898b\u308b (to see)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b (to be seen)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u53f1\u308b (to scold)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u53f1\u3089\u308c\u308b (to be scolded)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u98df\u3079\u308b (to eat)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u308b (to be eaten)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u58f2\u308b (to sell)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u58f2\u3089\u308c\u308b (to be sold)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u5909\u3048\u308b (to change)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5909\u3048\u3089\u308c\u308b (to be changed)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u53d6\u308b (to take)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u53d6\u3089\u308c\u308b (to be taken)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u8912\u3081\u308b (to praise)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u8912\u3081\u3089\u308c\u308b (to be praised)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u76d7\u3080 (to steal)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u76d7\u307e\u308c\u308b (to be stolen)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u4fe1\u3058\u308b (to believe)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u4fe1\u3058\u3089\u308c\u308b (to be believed)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u66f8\u304f (to write)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u66f8\u304b\u308c\u308b (to be written)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u6368\u3066\u308b (to throw away)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u6368\u3066\u3089\u308c\u308b (to be thrown away)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u96e2\u3059 (to separate)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u96e2\u3055\u308c\u308b (to be separated)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b (to find)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u898b\u3064\u3051\u3089\u308c\u308b (to be found)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u4f7f\u3046 (to use)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u308b (to be used)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u7981\u3058\u308b (to ban)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7981\u3058\u3089\u308c\u308b (to be banned)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u904b\u3076 (to carry)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u904b\u3070\u308c\u308b (to be carried)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u52a0\u3048\u308b (to add)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u52a0\u3048\u3089\u308c\u308b (to be added)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u8cb7\u3046 (to buy)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u8cb7\u308f\u308c\u308b (to be bought)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u8abf\u3079\u308b (to investigate)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u8abf\u3079\u3089\u308c\u308b (to be investigated)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u6b8b\u3059 (to leave)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u6b8b\u3055\u308c\u308b (to be left)<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Irregular Verbs<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;\u3059\u308b (to do)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3055\u308c\u308b* (to be done)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u6765\u308b (to come)<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u6765\u3089\u308c\u308b (to have come**)<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>*: \u3055\u308c\u308b has the older form \u305b\u3089\u308c\u308b, which is still occasionally found in the written language. <br>**: In English, the passive verb can only be made with transitive verbs (those with a direct object the subject actively does something to). This restriction, however, does not exist in Japanese, resulting in all verbs (minus the copula verb) technically being able to take these passive endings. The resulting expressions are referred sometimes as &#8220;indirect passive&#8221; or &#8220;painful passive,&#8221; and they will be the focus of our next lesson. For now, we will focus on &#8220;direct passive&#8221; expressions, those which use transitive verbs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;\u4e94\u6bb5<\/td><td>&nbsp;To take\u3000<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u53d6\u308b\u3000\u2192\u3000\u53d6\u3089\u308c\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u4e00\u6bb5<\/td><td>&nbsp;To eat<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u98df\u3079\u308b\u3000\u2192\u3000\u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u308b<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u4e00\u6bb5<\/td><td>&nbsp;To see<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u898b\u308b\u3000\u2192\u3000\u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u4e94\u6bb5<\/td><td>&nbsp;To swim<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u6cf3\u3050\u3000\u2192\u3000\u6cf3\u304c\u308c\u308b<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u30ab\u5909<\/td><td>&nbsp;To come<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u6765\uff08\u304f\uff09\u308b\u3000\u2192\u3000\u6765\uff08\u3053\uff09\u3089\u308c\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u4e94\u6bb5<\/td><td>&nbsp;To buy<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u8cb7\u3046\u3000\u2192\u3000\u8cb7\u308f\u308c\u308b<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u30b5\u5909<\/td><td>&nbsp;To do<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3059\u308b\u3000\u2192\u3000\u3055\u308c\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u4e00\u6bb5<\/td><td>&nbsp;To change<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5909\u308f\u308b\u3000\u2192\u3000\u5909\u308f\u308c\u308b<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u4e94\u6bb5<\/td><td>&nbsp;To carry<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u904b\u3076\u3000\u2192\u3000\u904b\u3070\u308c\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u4e00\u6bb5<\/td><td>&nbsp;To slip off<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u8131\u3052\u308b\u3000\u2192\u3000\u8131\u3052\u3089\u308c\u308b<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u4e94\u6bb5<\/td><td>&nbsp;To steal<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u76d7\u3080\u3000\u2192\u3000\u76d7\u307e\u308c\u308b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u4e94\u6bb5<\/td><td>&nbsp;To indulge<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u8caa\uff08\u3080\u3055\u307c\uff09\u308b\u3000\u2192\u3000\u8caa\u3089\u308c\u308b<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u4e94\u6bb5<\/td><td>&nbsp;To fasten<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u7e4b\uff08\u3064\u306a\uff09\u3050\u3000\u2192 \u7e4b\u304c\u308c\u308b\u3000<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u4e94\u6bb5<\/td><td>&nbsp;To wait<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u5f85\u3064\u3000\u2192\u3000\u5f85\u305f\u308c\u308b<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Passive (\u53d7\u8eab\u5f62)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>&#8216;Direct&#8217; Passive<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the introduction to this lesson, we heard the fate of a turtle that got eaten by a seagull. &#8220;Eaten&#8221; is the passive form of the verb &#8220;to eat&#8221; in English. For contrast, consider the following.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>i. The seagull ate the little turtle. (Non-passive)<br>ii. The little turtle was eaten by a seagull. (Passive)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing to note is that the object of the non-passive sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence. Additionally, the subject of the non-passive sentences becomes the indirect agent of the passive sentence, which is marked in English with the preposition &#8220;by.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what happens in Japanese? First, you need to know which particles follow each noun phrase in the sentence in question. When dealing with non-passive sentences, nothing out of the ordinary occurs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>i. \u30ab\u30e2\u30e1\u304c\u5b50\u4e80\u3092\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3002<br><br>In the passive, we know that \u5b50\u4e80 would then get marked by \u304c, but \u30ab\u30e2\u30e1 can&#8217;t be marked by \u3092 because that marks a direct object. Therefore, another particle must be used to mark the action performer (indirect agent). That particle is the particle \u306b\uff0e&nbsp;<br><br>ii. \u5b50\u4e80\u304c\u30ab\u30e2\u30e1\u306b\u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3002<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a passive sentence there is an&nbsp;<strong>action receiver and an action performer<\/strong>. The action received is always there: it&#8217;s the passive verb. What&nbsp;<em>may or may not&nbsp;<\/em>be there is the receiver and or the performer. This is because the standard rule of Japanese grammar that allows for the omission of understood information equally applies to passive structures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. \u3042\u306e\u87fb\u585a\u306b\u3044\u305f\u30a2\u30ea\u305f\u3061\u306f\u306a\u3093\u3068<ruby>\u5f1f<\/ruby>\u306b<ruby>\u98df<rt>\u304f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u308f\u308c\u305f\u3088\uff01&nbsp;

For the majority of Japanese&#8217;s history, these two things were expressed by the same endings, with context being the deciding factor as to how interpret them. This is certainly still the case for \uff5e\u3089\u308c\u308b, which remains the standard ending for both the passive and potential for \u4e00\u6bb5 verbs and \u6765\u308b.&nbsp;<br><br>However, ever since the invent of the shorter potential forms of \u4e94\u6bb5 verbs, the ending \uff5e\u308c\u308b is rarely used to mean &#8220;to be able to.&#8221; Using \u884c\u3051\u308b, for instance, instead of \u884c\u304b\u308c\u308b has become standard within the last century. There are still speakers who use the traditional \uff5e\u308c\u308b for these verbs, but you are more likely to see this in literature.&nbsp;<br><br>Distinguishing between the passive and potential meanings of \uff5e\u3089\u308c\u308b and \uff5e\u308c\u308b&nbsp;may seem confusing, but context and particle usage will always help in determining which is meant. Ex. 47 is a great example of a bridging context between the two meanings as there is logical overlap between the two, whereas only the potential meaning is possible in the very similar Ex. 48.
