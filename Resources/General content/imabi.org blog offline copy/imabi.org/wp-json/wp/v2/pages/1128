They are typically rare, but they feature the mouth radical. The reason why they deserve special attention is that you may not realize at first hand that they&#8217;re onomatopoeic. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Onomatopoeia from Chinese<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Chinese the large majority of onomatopoeic expressions are made up of \u6f22\u5b57 with the mouth radical \u53e3. Individual characters are often repeated in the same way \u3053\u305d is repeated in \u3053\u305d\u3053\u305d. There are also many instances when the characters may be different, but the readings are still very similar. At other times, there isn&#8217;t any apparent symmetry. However, if we think of English expressions like &#8220;kaboom&#8221;, this doesn&#8217;t have to be a requirement for something to be onomatopoeia.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, we must understand that things Sino-Japanese tend to be literary. Because native onomatopoeia is so natural of spoken speech, we can expect Chinese onomatopoeic expressions to enter Japanese as rather technical words and may not quite be used or viewed as onomatopoeia. Some readily are viewed as such as seen in Ex. 1 and 2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, it is certain that you will hardly find most of these spoken. These words are important, though, in higher class literature in which even today new Sino-Japanese expressions may be imported. For you as the advanced learner, running into new characters in this section may very well be the most beneficial and important thing to this lesson.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Examples<\/u><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><ruby>1. \u5471\u5471<rt>\u3053\u3053<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306e<ruby>\u58f0<rt>\u3053\u3048<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3092\u3042\u3052\u308b\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; To make one&#8217;s first cry.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;\uff5b<ruby>\u5475\u5475<rt>\u304b\u304b<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3068\u30fb<ruby>\u5927\u58f0<rt>\u304a\u304a\u3054\u3048<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3067\uff5d<ruby>\u7b11<rt>\u308f\u3089<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3044<ruby>\u7d9a<rt>\u3064\u3065<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3051\u308b\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To continue to laugh loudly. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;<ruby>\u56a0\u55a8<rt>\u308a\u3085\u3046\u308a\u3087\u3046<\/rt><\/ruby>\u305f\u308b\u97f3\u8272<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Clear and resounding tone\/sound<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. \u9ad8\u8a55<strong><ruby>\u5616\u5616<rt>\u3055\u304f\u3055\u304f<\/rt><\/ruby><\/strong><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The resounding of high reputation<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.&nbsp;<ruby>\u563b\u563b<rt>\u304d\u304d<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3068\u3057\u3066\u904a\u3076\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To play cheerfully.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.&nbsp;<ruby>\u55a8\u3005<rt>\u308a\u3087\u3046\u308a\u3087\u3046<\/rt><\/ruby>\u305f\u308b\u97ff\u304d<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; A reverberating echo<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7.&nbsp;<ruby>\u5583\u3005<rt>\u306a\u3093\u306a\u3093<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3068<ruby>\u99c4\u5f01<rt>\u3060\u3079\u3093<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3092<ruby>\u5f04<rt>\u308d\u3046<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3059\u308b\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; To babble and speak rubbish.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8.&nbsp;<ruby>\u9b3c\u54ed\u557e\u557e<rt>\u304d\u3053\u304f\u3057\u3085\u3046\u3057\u3085\u3046<\/rt><\/ruby>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The groaning of a dead spirit<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9.&nbsp;<ruby>\u5436\u3005<rt>\u3068\u3064\u3068\u3064<\/rt><\/ruby><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Faltering<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next are examples that really seem to have lost any sense of being onomatopoeic in Japanese.
