Japanese doesn&#8217;t have true ordinal number forms like English, but there are several ways to make such expressions. Decisions such as which prefix and or suffix should be used and what kind of number should be used, Sino-Japanese and native, cause nuance differences that shouldn&#8217;t be overlooked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Practicality is also a factor, but this is no reason to ignore sections of this lesson. As the words \u201cordinal\u201d and \u9806\u5e8f suggest, ordinal numbers show ordering. In English they\u2019re used in giving the date, century, fractions, generations, etc. These usages, though, are taken over in Japanese by counters. However, in phrases such as \u201cfirst intersection\u201d, ordinal number expressions are still used in Japanese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll find that ordinal number-like expressions in Japanese have limitations, and they aren&#8217;t quite straightforward. This lesson will try to give guidelines as to how exactly they are used, so pay close attention to details.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Ordinal Number Patterns<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>\u7b2c\uff03<\/u><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Sino-Japanese numbers, the prefix \u7b2c\uff5e can be used, which brings a considerable level of formality. For instance, \u7b2c\u4e8c means \u201csecond\u201d. You see it a lot in things like \u7b2c\u4e8c\u306b (secondly) and \u7b2c\u4e8c\u306e\u4eba\u751f (second life).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also see it used with counter expressions and nouns afterward like \u7b2c1\u8ab2 (Lesson 1), \u7b2c\u4e00\u4f4d (first place), and \u7b2c\u4e8c\u306e\u8ad6\u70b9 (second point of issue). \u7b2c\uff03 is extremely limited, though. It is true that you hear \u7b2c\u4e00 and \u7b2c\u4e8c used as adverbs in listing points. And, you can see \u7b2c\uff03\u306eNoun all the time for any number. However, when you pass two, using \u7b2c\uff03 in an adverbial sense (firstly, secondly) becomes unnatural. As such, to clearly use this pattern adverbially, the particle \u306b becomes necessary. So, rather than stating a third point with \u7b2c\u4e09, do so with \u7b2c\u4e09\u306b.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>i. \u7b2c\u4e00\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u6280\u8853\u8005<br>The foremost engineers of Japan<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ii. \u7b2c\u4e00\uff08\u3001\uff09\u8aac\u660e\u3057\u3066\u3082\u8ab0\u3082\u805e\u3044\u3066\u304f\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3093\u3060\u3002<br>First(ly), even if I explained, no one&#8217;ll listen to me.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>iii. \u7b2c\u4e09\u306b\u3001\u4f1a\u793e\u54e1\u304c\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u30b4\u30df\u3092\u6368\u3066\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u306a\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3068\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<br>Thirdly, it has been decided that employees must throw away their own trash. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This does not negate the grammaticality of phrases like \u7b2c\u4e09\u306e\u554f\u984c. In English this would be &#8220;third problem&#8221;, but the Japanese, like the English, is ambiguous on whether the problem number is 3 or whether it is simply the third problem being touched on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, this is more indicative of written Japanese. In regards to proper nouns and this pattern, you can see things like \u7b2c\u4e00\u30db\u30c6\u30eb and \u7b2c\u4e00\u88fd\u85ac, but you don&#8217;t see any other number with them unless if it were a play on words. So, typically, you would never see something like \u7b2c\u4e09\u30db\u30c6\u30eb.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When do you distinguish this from just a \uff03\uff0bCounter? This is a very difficult question that really depends on what you&#8217;re using. For instance, when counting floors of a building, you simply use the counter \uff5e\u968e. If you were to use \u7b2c, it wouldn&#8217;t quite be the same sense of the word. For instance, you can see things like \u7b2c2\u968e\u5dee\u6570\u5217 (second differences sequence).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>(\u7b2c)#\u756a<\/u><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, there is the counter \uff5e\u756a. \u756a itself is a noun for \u201cturn\/order\/place\u201d. When used as a counter, it is equivalent to &#8220;No.&#8221;. One instance that these are used is the parts of a hearing test. This is also used for giving the order of those that win a lottery. So, you get something like \u4e8c\u756a\u306f\u5f7c\u3067\u3059.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, again, shows the number that something has. For instance, if a street is named with a number, for instance First Avenue\/Avenue 1, then its Japanese equivalent would be \u4e00\u756a\u8857. Like the English expression, however, \uff03\u756a\u8857 is used for avenues\/streets with a lot of people and or businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible to see \u7b2c with such expressions, but the sense of there being a \u201cNo.\u201d is still there. For instance, \u7b2c2\u756a\u306e\u4ea4\u5dee\u70b9 is a slightly uncommon\/unnatural way of saying \u201cIntersection No. 2\u201d. It is slightly more common to see this without the \u7b2c.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another practical usage is \uff03\u756a\u7dda. This is used to mentioning the number of a train line, not the number of a train (\u5217\u8eca\u756a\u53f7). \u756a\u5730 is used for house\/property number, and unlike these other examples, it is also practically used with large numbers. So, it is possible to see 1000\u756a\u5730. In short, this is used when there is number posted on something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also the usage of \u4e00\u756a as \u201cmost\u201d. However, past 1, you would have to use \uff03\u756a\u76ee. So, the second most high-ranking person would be 2\u756a\u76ee\u306b\u5049\u3044\u4eba. It\u2019s not right to use 2\u756a here. Now, having said this, what would happen if in regards to a lottery you were to say \u4e00\u756a\u76ee\u304c\u79c1\u30012\u756a\u76ee\u306f\u5f7c\u3067\u3059? Well, then it would sound like you&#8217;re talking about different lottery drawings, not separate drawings after each other in a single event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The confusion in semantics can cause natives to question the legitimacy of phrases such as the last one. This is why thoughtful consideration of detail and awareness of context is so important to discourse in any language.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>\uff03\u756a\u76ee<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, there is \uff03\u756a\u76ee. This has a very distinct spatial\/temporal sense about it. It can also be used in sense where it\u2019s not that one is counting it. It\u2019s just factually the case. For instance, in reference to the third hurricane to reach the Gulf of Mexico, one would use 3\u756a\u76ee. This, in comparison with the next option, has no real number limit. This is also of the same vein as \uff03Counter\uff0b\u76ee. For instance, the third book is \uff13\u518a\u76ee\uff08\u306e\u672c\uff09.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>Native Number \uff0b \u3064 \uff0b\u3000\u76ee<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common in the spoken language is definitely \u201cNative number + \u3064 \uff0b \u76ee\u201d. After nine, it is replaced with \uff03\u756a\u76ee\u30fb\uff03\u500b\u76ee, the latter specifically counting things of course.<br>This pattern definitely has the greater sense of counting, despite the fact that all of these patterns are ordinal number patterns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There isn&#8217;t necessarily a strong relation to temporal\/spatial distance. It could be in reference to things. Although \uff03\u756a\u76ee can be used with things too, it\u2019s hard to pull away a sense of distance or time from it. For instance, 2\u756a\u76ee\u306e\u99c5 is something you could definitely hear when being told how to get somewhere. From where you and the explainer are standing, there is a spatial sense of two train stations away from you. Although you could definitely hear 2\u3064\u76ee\u306e\u99c5, one could say that this has broader implications and has no relation to distance, and if it were used in the same instance as above, that\u2019s coincidental.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A common question that is often brushed off by the most sincere natives is the existence of \u5341\u76ee. Sadly, it does exist in rare phrases like \u56db\u76ee\u5341\u76ee, which comes from a superstition of an age difference between a married couple 3 to 9 years bad, so they get rounded to 4 and 10 instead. This, though, is homophonous with the phrase \u591c\u76ee\u9060\u76ee (being seen in the distance).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Practically, though, yes, the pattern \u201cNative number + \u3064 \uff0b \u76ee\u201d ends at 9. Even so, if you were to say 9\u3064\u306e\u4fe1\u53f7 (ninth light) in giving instructions, you might cause the traveler some anxiety as to how far away something is. Had you said 9\u756a\u306e\u4fe1\u53f7, it may be next to you if that\u2019s the name of it. Or, if you had said \uff19\u756a\u76ee\u306e\u4fe1\u53f7, the light is no doubt in a series, but the sense of a number limit is nonexistent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, native numbers past ten could be made like \u201c\u3068\u304a \u3042\u307e\u308a \uff03\u3064\u201d, but this has been reduced to rare instances and Classical Japanese. You can still sometimes see the original native number framework outside of 1~10, \u306f\u305f\u3061, in things like \u4e09\u5341\u4e00\u6587\u5b57, which is used to mean Waka\/Tanka poetry. Another fun fact is that \u4e00\u3064\u76ee\u5c0f\u50e7 actually means \u201cone-eyed boy phantom\u201d.
