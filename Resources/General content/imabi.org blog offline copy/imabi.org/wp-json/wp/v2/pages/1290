As voiced sounds were believed to have had pre-nasalization, it would have been treated as a single mora. Thus, \u3067 was born. Once \u3042\u308a changed to \u3042\u308b, \u3067\u3042\u308b was formed. Then, \u3067\u3042\u308b contracted to \u3060 in the East and \u3058\u3083 in the West. When \u6771\u4eac became the capital, \u6771\u4eac\u5f01 became standard and so did \u3060.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for \u3067\u3059, etymology is a little unclear. It&#8217;s clear that the \u3067 must have derived from \u306b\u3066, but the latter element has been interpreted in two primary ways. One theory of thought suggests that the predecessor of \u3067\u3059 was \u3067\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059, which is easy for Modern Japanese speakers and learners alike to understand. If one knew that \u3067\u3054\u3056\u3093\u3059 was used a lot in the Edo Period in East Japan and that dialects in this region of Japan are known for truncating long phrases drastically, this relation is quite logical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another theory proposes that the predecessor is actually \u3067\u5019. \u5019, which is rendered as \u305d\u3046\u308d\u3046 in Modern Orthography and \u3055\u3046\u3089\u3075 in Old Orthography, was a formal auxiliary used primarily in texts now understandably called \u5019\u6587. There are truncated forms of \u5019 such as \u305d\u308d\u3046. However, there needs to be a reason for why it is further truncated and why a vowel change happened after the truncation. Vowel changes on the individual word level are not uncommon in Japanese dialects. So, this is not impossible. However, the fact that \u3067\u3059 has always been associated with the &#8220;spoken language&#8221; makes the connection implausible from a social linguistic standpoint.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Copula Verb \u305f\u308a<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The copula \u305f\u308a, from the particle \u3068 + \u3042\u308a, appeared in the \u5e73\u5b89\u6642\u4ee3 and was often used to emphasize the qualities of someone.
