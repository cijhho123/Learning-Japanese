This is where the form \u3057\u3082 comes to play, which is sometimes classified as a bound particle with there being \u3082.

This approximation deals with numbers, place, age, time, weight, etc. It can also show degree\/extent. The use of &#8220;just&#8221;, which is also found in Modern Japanese, began in the \u5e73\u5b89\u6642\u4ee3. This is pretty distinguishable from the other usage because it wouldn&#8217;t be used with a &#8220;counter\/quantity noun&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the intense repetition usage found in things like \u9cf4\u3044\u3066\u3070\u304b\u308a\u3044\u308b in Modern Japanese started out in the \u938c\u5009\u6642\u4ee3 as a final particle usage, but now it is the most important usage, with its use for &#8220;just&#8221; as a means of restriction being almost entirely given to \u3060\u3051 and its approximation usage fighting with \u304f\u3089\u3044 over minute semantics (Lesson 83).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Origin Note<\/strong>: The particle \u3070\u304b\u308a comes from the verb \u8a08\u308b. If you know that \u306f\u304b\u308a\u30fb\u79e4 means a &#8220;scale\/weighing machine&#8221; even to this day, you can see the direct correlation it has with its fundamental meaning of showing approximation, which all of its other usages evolved from over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sound Change Note<\/strong>: Starting in the \u6c5f\u6238\u6642\u4ee3, the particle underwent dialectical sound changes, of which some have survived into Modern Japanese as slang\/colloquial variants.

So, at least in the \u5948\u826f\u6642\u4ee3, the two particles weren&#8217;t really confused in function with each other. There wasn&#8217;t even any true consistency on how it was used with case particles. Combinations like \u3092\u3059\u3089, \u3059\u3089\u3092, \u3059\u3089\u306b, \u306b\u3059\u3089, etc. were all common. At one point it also appeared as \u305d\u3089, and managed to survive into Modern Japanese be being consistently used in writing. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u3055\u3048 is slightly different in that it can mean &#8220;on top of that&#8221; and show minimal example. &#8220;Minimal example&#8221; in Modern Japanese can appear as \u3067\u3055\u3048\uff08\u3082\uff09 to distinguish the usages. It came from the verb &#8220;to add&#8221;, \u6dfb\u3075\uff0e This shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise. It too was used in the ancient period. With the similar roles of \u3060\u306b, \u3059\u3089, and \u3055\u3048, it&#8217;s not surprising that they&#8217;d be confused with each other and that one would become used more than the others as a result. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>Examples<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>31. \u4eca\u4e00\u5ea6\u8072\u3092\u3060\u306b\u805e\u304b\u305b\u7d66\u3078\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now let me hear your voice at least once.<br>From the \u6e90\u6c0f\u7269\u8a9e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>32. \u304b\u305f\u307f\u306b\u6253\u3061\u3066\u3001\u7537\u3092\u3055\u3078\u305e\u6253\u3064\u3081\u308b\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They took turns hitting each other, and it appears that they even hit the men!<br>From the \u6795\u8349\u5b50.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>33. \u6607\u3089\u3093\u3092\u3060\u306b\u898b\u9001\u308a\u7d66\u3078\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the very least, watch me ascend.<br>From the \u7af9\u53d6\u7269\u8a9e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>34. \u8a00\u4e0d\u554f \u6728\u5c1a\u59b9\u8208\u5144 \u6709\u4e91\u4e4e \u76f4\u72ec\u5b50\u5c13 \u6709\u4e4b\u82e6\u8005\u3000(\u539f\u6587)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \u8a00\u554f\u306f\u306c\u6728\u3059\u3089<ruby>\u59b9<rt>\u3044\u3082<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3068<ruby>\u5144<rt>\u305b<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3042\u308a\u3068\u3075\u3092\u305f\u3060<ruby>\u72ec\u5b50<rt>\u3072\u3068\u308a\u3054<\/rt><\/ruby>\u306b\u3042\u308b\u304c\u82e6\u3057\u3055\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They say that even the mute tree has sisters and brothers; oh how hard it must be as an only child!<br>From the \u4e07\u8449\u96c6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>35. \u3072\u3068\u3064\u5b50\u306b\u3055\u3078\u3042\u308a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u3001\u3044\u3068\u304b\u306a\u3057\u3046\u3057\u7d66\u3072\u3051\u308a\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, since he was the only child, (the mother) was even more saddened.<br>From the \u4f0a\u52e2\u7269\u8a9e.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>36. \u661f\u306e\u5149\u3060\u306b\u898b\u3048\u305a\u6697\u304d\u306b\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was dark and even the light of the stars wasn&#8217;t visible.<br>From the \u66f4\u7d1a\u65e5\u8a18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>37. \u4eba\u6240\u5bdd \u5473\u5bbf\u4e0d\u5bdd \u65e9\u6577\u516b\u56db \u516c\u76ee\u5c1a \u6b32\u5606\u3000(\u539f\u6587)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\u4eba\u306e\u5bdd\u308b \u5473\u7720\u306f\u5bdd\u305a\u3066<ruby>\u611b<rt>\u306f<\/rt><\/ruby>\u3057\u304d\u3084\u3057 \u541b\u304c\u76ee\u3059\u3089\u3092\u6b32\u308a\u3066\u5606\u304f\u3082\u3002<br>\u3000\u3000 Having not had sweet sleep with someone, my dear, I sigh desiring at least a glimpse of you.<br>From the \u4e07\u8449\u96c6.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u7b2c032\u8ab2: Adverbial Particles All of the particles that will be discussed in this lesson are those that you shoul<a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https:\/\/imabi.org\/adverbial-particles\/\">\u7d9a\u304d\u3092\u8aad\u3080 <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">&#8220;Adverbial Particles&#8221;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":158153075,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"footnotes":""},"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1360","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry"],"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/PeXUlI-lW","jetpack-related-posts":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1360","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/158153075"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1360"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1360\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1362,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1360\/revisions\/1362"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1360"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/imabi.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1360"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
