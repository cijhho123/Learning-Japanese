This affix is \/-aku\/\u203b, but because the initial vowel always fuses with the preceding mora, as was a phonological rule in Old Japanese, the resulting \uff5e\u30af is how it has been recognized over the millennia.<br><br>\u203bThis posited morpheme was proposed by \u5927\u91ce (1952). \/-aku\/ has also been related to the \/aku\/ found in the classical form of the verb \u61a7\u308c\u308b (to yearn for) &#8211; \/akugaru\/ &#8211; interpreting \/aku\/ as having once been a generic nominalizer indicating &#8220;place&#8221; and \/karu\/ as \u96e2\u308b, an Old Japanese verb meaning &#8220;to separate.&#8221; Some have also suggested that \/-aku\/ may be an ancient borrowing of the Korean word \uac83 \/geot\/, which is the Korean equivalent of \u3053\u3068\u30fb\u3082\u306e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conjugating with \/-aku\/<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As should be expected of a nominalizing dummy noun, \/-aku\/ follows the \u9023\u4f53\u5f62 of various parts of speech: verbs, adjectives, and auxiliary verbs attached to verbs and\/or adjectives. In the conjugation table below, forms are shown as they are to be understood in Old Japanese. This is because the grammar pattern itself had already been limited to fossilized by the start of the Heian Period, requiring us to turn back the clock. As such, all words are written in historical kana orthography.

In the first scenario, the relative pronoun &#8220;one&#8221; is at play in English, and in the second scenario, we see the verb &#8220;to see&#8221; used in its participial form (-ing). The word &#8220;apposition&#8221; refers to when two elements side by side relate to the same thing but are expressed differently. In this case, \u306e is the appositive element. <br><br>In relation to \u30af\u8a9e\u6cd5, only the second scenario is attested. However, it is the first scenario that is most \u3082\u306e-like. As the example even shows, the \u306e adnominal is very much the agent of an action, but the \u306e adnominal in the second scenario is not an agent, and the verbal predicate that follows is limited as a consequence to whatever is logical for the situation being described. This is what makes the second scenario so akin to \u3053\u3068. Relating this back to \u30af\u8a9e\u6cd5 once again, this explains why adjectival predicates are so much more common but also why verbal predicates are not out of the question. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another factor as to why \/-aku\/ has been said to not translate as \u3082\u306e is its apparent unaccusative\/ergative nature.<br> <br>\u30fbIf a nominalized adjective cannot then be used theoretically as the object of a transitive verb, then it is referring to a \u3082\u306e in a given situation, but there is no restriction on what is going on or happening to it. \/-aku\/ cannot be used in this manner as it would render it as a relative pronoun with greater nominal properties than it actually has. <br><br>\u30fbIf a nominalized adjective\/verb can be used as the object of a transitive verb but is currently the subject of the main clause, then it is referring to a \u3053\u3068, and the main clause is describing the predicament that said \u3053\u3068 is in. This predicament may be expressed with a transitive verb\u203b, an intransitive verb\u203b, or an adjective, but it must describe what is affecting the speaker emotionally. Intransitive verbs will necessarily be verbs of motion in which there is some entity that can be perceived as being an agent. <br>\u203bThe transitive verbs most often seen in the main clause predicate after \/-aku\/ are: \u6b32\u308b (to want), \u601d\u3075 (to think), \u77e5\u308b (to know), \u898b\u308b (to see), and \u5fd8\u308b (to forget).<br><br>11. \u7269\u7686\u306f\uff5b\u65b0\u3057\u304d \u3007\u30fb\u65b0\u3057\u3051\u304f X\uff5d\u826f\u3057\u3001\u305f\u3060\u3057\u304f\u3082\u4eba\u306f\u53e4\u308a\u306b\u3057\u5b9c\u3057\u304b\u308b\u3079\u3057<br>Everything being new is fine; however, as for people, ending up old is best.<br>From Poem 1885 of the \u4e07\u8449\u96c6. <br><br>12. \u4e2d\u306b\u3092\u5bdd\u3080\u3068\u611b\u3057\u304f\u3057\u304c\u8a9e\u3089\u3078\u3070\u3044\u3064\u3057\u304b\u3082\u4eba\u3068\u306a\u308a\u51fa\u3067\u3066\u60aa\u3051\u304f\u3082\u826f\u3051\u304f\u3082\u898b\u3080\u3068<br>With how cute he was talking about how he wanted to sleep in between us, I really wanted to see the good and the bad as he grew up&#8230;<br>From Poem 904 of the \u4e07\u8449\u96c6.<br><br>13. \u3053\u306e\u3053\u308d\u306e\u604b\u306e\u7e41\u3051\u304f\u3001\u590f\u8349\u306e\u5208\u308a\u6255\u3078\u3069\u3082\u751f\u3072\u3057\u304f\u3054\u3068\u3057<br>There has been so much love these days that it would just grow like crazy all over like summer grasses do when you cut them.<br>From Poem 1984 of the \u4e07\u8449\u96c6<br><br>14a. \u8863\u624b\u5e38\u9678\u306e\u56fd\u306e\u4e8c\u4e26\u3076\u7b51\u6ce2\u306e\u5c71\u3092\u898b\u307e\u304f\u6b32\u308a\u541b\u6765\u307e\u305b\u308a\u3068\u6691\u3051\u304f\u306b\u6c57\u304b\u304d\u5606\u3052<br>Since you so wanted to see Mt.
