In the first response, you are objective stating that it is impossible to decide. In the second situation, you state that you can\u2019t 100% call him the criminal because there is still some doubt. In the third response, you can\u2019t say that he is the criminal given the surrounding circumstances. It is also very uncommon to use this in \u8a71\u3057\u8a00\u8449. The fourth response implies that you refrain from stating definitively that he is the criminal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the last comment, you can see how \uff5e\u304b\u306d\u308b can be used in polite contexts in denying\/rejecting things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>32. \u3044\u308d\u3044\u308d\u8003\u616e\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u304a\u5f15\u304d\u53d7\u3051\u3057\u304b\u306d\u307e\u3059\u3002<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#8217;ve thought hard on this, but I cannot undertake it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, even in situations where all are possible, there will be differences as defined thus far.

Again, as for \uff5e\u3048\u306a\u3044, a consensus of the various circumstances can\u2019t be made.
