Nevertheless, the language still places heavy emphasis on choosing the correct register to address others. \u656c\u8a9e makes oneself look more educated and better when used appropriately. Always&nbsp;<strong>consider the listener&#8217;s position versus that of your own<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone has trouble with&nbsp;\u656c\u8a9e including Japanese people. Many honorific phrases are old-fashioned, but that shouldn&#8217;t downplay the importance of \u656c\u8a9e. Interesting phenomenons today include &#8220;X\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059&#8221; instead of &#8220;X\u3067\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059&#8221;. The first is traditionally incorrect. However, it is so common now that it is here to stay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what kind of expressions are in \u656c\u8a9e? As you should know by now, \u656c\u8a9e is usually split up into three kinds: \u5c0a\u656c\u8a9e (respectful speech), \u8b19\u8b72\u8a9e\u30fb\u8b19\u905c\u8a9e (humble speech), and \u4e01\u5be7\u8a9e (polite speech). However, there are other phrases based off words and phrases found in \u656c\u8a9e that serve the opposite purpose of being rude. This can be very complicated, but we will look at some examples as to how that can be the case. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;Type<\/td><td>&nbsp;Object of Respect<\/td><td>&nbsp;Type of respect?<\/td><td>&nbsp;Subject of Action<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u4f8b\u6587<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u5c0a\u656c\u8a9e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u76f8\u624b<\/td><td>&nbsp;Yes<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u76f8\u624b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u90e8\u9577\u304c<strong>\u304a<\/strong>\u8a71\u3057<strong>\u4e0b\u3055\u3044<\/strong>\u3002<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u8b19\u8b72\u8a9e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u81ea\u5206<\/td><td>&nbsp;No<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u81ea\u5206<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u79c1\u304c<strong>\u304a<\/strong>\u8a71\u3057<strong>\u3057\u307e\u3059<\/strong>\u3002<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u4e01\u5be7\u8a9e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u805e\u304d\u624b<\/td><td>&nbsp;Yes<\/td><td>&nbsp;X<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u3053\u3061\u3089\u306b\u30da\u30f3\u304c<strong>\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059<\/strong>\u3002<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u5c0a\u5927\u8a9e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u81ea\u5206<\/td><td>&nbsp;Yes*<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u81ea\u5206<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u4ffa<strong>\u69d8<\/strong>\u304c\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3084\u308d\u3046\uff01<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&nbsp;\u8efd\u8511\u8a9e<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u76f8\u624b<\/td><td>&nbsp;No<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u76f8\u624b<\/td><td>&nbsp;\u65e9\u304f\u3057<strong>\u3084\u304c\u308c<\/strong>\uff01<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>*: To yourself, which is why it&#8217;s boastful.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Terminology Note<\/strong>:<br>1. \u4e01\u5be7\u8a9e used intransitively is specifically called \u4e01\u91cd\u8a9e.<br>2. \u5c0a\u656c\u8a9e&nbsp;is<em>&nbsp;used to give\/pay respect to one&#8217;s out-group or to superiors in one&#8217;s in-group<\/em>.&nbsp;<br>3. \u8b19\u8b72\u8a9e&nbsp;is<em>&nbsp;used to lower oneself or one&#8217;s in-group<\/em>.&nbsp;<br>4. \u5c0a\u5927\u8a9e takes items meant for showing respect to others to direct respect to oneself in a boastful manner.&nbsp;<br>5.&nbsp;<ruby>\u8efd\u8511\u8a9e<rt>\u3051\u3044\u3079\u3064\u3054<\/rt><\/ruby>&nbsp;does not necessarily share vocabulary with the above kinds of speech, but it is the opposite of \u5c0a\u656c\u8a9e.

To some, including Japanese people, it is very hard to not always speak of your boss respectfully, but when you&#8217;re&nbsp;<strong><u>addressing someone in one&#8217;s out-group<\/u><\/strong>, you refer to people in your in-group, including your boss, with humble speech.
