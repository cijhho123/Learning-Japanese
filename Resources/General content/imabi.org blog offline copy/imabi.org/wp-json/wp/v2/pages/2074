In fact, several factors can prevent \u306b from being used in tandem. <br><br>Non-deictic expressions are adverbial nouns. An oversimplification of when not to expect \u306b in non-deictic contexts hinges on how adverbial the preceding temporal &#8220;noun&#8221; is. Let&#8217;s look at a few contingencies. <br><br>i. When a non-deictic expression modifies a noun, it is being used as a noun. <br>The combination \u306b\u306e itself is invalid; therefore, \u306b cannot follow.<br>ii. Topicalizing a non-deictic expression often results in \u306b being dropped because the particle \u306f heightens its adverbial nature.<br>iii. When a deictic expression modifies a non-deictic expression, \u306b ought not be present except when a contrast is being made with another time period (Ex. 12) or when there is a clear reference point like a date on a calendar or when telling time\u2014Exs. 14-15.<br>iv. When the events of the main clause are given greater semantic weight in the sentence, \u306b is often dropped. This is especially so when non-deictic expressions are in sentence-initial position and can be viewed as being tacked on to the more important information\u2014Ex 13. <br>v. Many contexts exemplary of iii-iv may also be viewed as being formal in tone. With formal tonality, a non-deictic expression, often longer reflecting being more detailed (Ex. 13), is typically sentence-initial with a notable pause before the rest of the sentence.<br>vi. When the main clause describes a condition versus an action, non-deictic expressions are not used with \u306b because they are viewed as adverbs qualifying the nature of said state of being\u2014Ex. 5.<br>vii. The particle choice(s) seen in set phrases are rigid, meaning they most likely cannot be altered. So, if \u306b is present, its grammaticality is certain\u2014Ex. 16.<br><br><strong>Comparison Note<\/strong>: English poses a similar problem to these scenarios in that &#8220;at\/on\/in&#8221; need not always be paired with non-deictic expressions either (Ex. 6).<br><br>Since \u306b is not a clear indicator as to whether a time phrase is deictic or non-deictic, determiners serve as a more reliable indicator.

As for \u7fcc\u671d\u306b\u3082, it is non-deictic because &#8220;the following morning&#8221; is only understood by the circumstance being referenced, as opposed to being anchored to &#8220;now.&#8221; Now, as for why \u306b is omissible from \u524d\u306e\u6669, this is in line with tonality adjustment on top of raising the phrase [\u524d\u306e\u6669] to the front of the sentence being akin to topicalization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\uff5b\u3053\u306e\u30fb\u305d\u306e\u30fb\u3042\u306e\uff5d\u524d\u306e\uff5e<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In deictic terminology, there is no need to use &#8220;this\/that&#8221; in conjunction with the main determiner &#8220;prior\/last&#8221; because of how the timeline is anchored to &#8220;now&#8221; as the point of reference.
