					<description><![CDATA[I copied vocabulary words from MS Word into Anki. The kanji and hiragana were in Yu Mincho Body and MS Gothic font; the English meaning was in Helvetica. They looked fine on my pc but when I loaded them into my Android the kanji characters on the front don&#039;t show up. The hiragana on the back show up  but the English meaning, which is on the same field as the hiragana does not. Is this likely a font problem? The only font options I see on my Android are Open Sans and I don&#039;t think that has a working Japanese version.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post! I installed Anki a couple of weeks ago to learn kanji and it really works! 
Do you know any flashcards for kanji phrases or japanese phrases with all the letters? :)
Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post, I&#039;ve been using Anki for literally everything I would like to remember. Although for Japanese specifically, I love to use WaniKani where you already have a &quot;learning plan&quot; made for you (I&#039;m not related to them other than being a user).]]></description>
