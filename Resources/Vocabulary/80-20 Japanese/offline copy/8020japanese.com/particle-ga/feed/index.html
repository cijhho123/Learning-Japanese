					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://8020japanese.com/particle-ga/#comment-10360&quot;&gt;John Gilbert&lt;/a&gt;.

I always read nouns with wa as „As for xy, …“ like it’s a subordinate clause. Then the book is the subject of the main clause, and naturally ga comes in. Almost as if you read „Akari no hon ga“. Just that then - to me - the focus is clearly in the book, and in the wa construct the focus is on Akari. But I‘m also only a beginner, and yet to grab all the subtleties…]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Call me crazy, but, in English, the phrase &#034;Tomorrow, rain will fall&#034;, Tomorrow is not the topic. Rain is.
If I said &#034;Yesterday, John murdered a family of four&#034; no one would ever say that th topic is Yesterday. It&#039;s an adverb that modifies the verb &#034;murdered&#034;.

As far as I can tell, considering a day or weekend the topic is a Japanese thing that we don&#039;t do in English. In fact, in English, you wouldn&#039;t ever say the topic can be defined by a single word in the sentence. In my sentence, John murdering is the topic.

Using the concept a &#034;topic&#034; to describe &#039;wa&#039; stopped working for me as soon as it stopped being used interchangably with the subject. Personally, I think of &#039;wa&#039; like a colon. &#034;Yesterday: John only pretended to murder a family of four.&#034; or &#034;John: he&#039;s an actor&#034;

But what do I know? I&#039;ve only been learning Japanese for a few weeks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://8020japanese.com/particle-ga/#comment-5808&quot;&gt;Oliver&lt;/a&gt;.

I know this is an old comment but for anyone who does come across this and doesn’t understand why “wakaru” cannot be the object.

 わかる wakaru (“to understand”) is an Intransitive Verb and therefore cannot have a direct object. This is why GA is used.

Only Transitive Verbs have Direct Objects and for that reason, they use the WO (o) particle.

わかる wakaru (“to understand”) should not be used with the WO (o) particle. GA is used to directly state that IT IS Japanese (“Nihongo”) relating to the verb.

There are also articles on other sites which cover Intransitive and Transitive Verbs.]]></description>

I know this is an old comment but for anyone who does come across this and doesn&#039;t understand why the &quot;book&quot; is not the object.

あります (&quot;to have&quot;) is an Intransitive Verb and therefore cannot have an object. This is why GA is used.

Only Transitive Verbs have Direct Objects and for that reason, they use the WO particle.

Because あります (&quot;to have&quot;) can&#039;t be used with an object, GA is used to directly state that IT IS the &quot;book&quot; relating to the verb.
