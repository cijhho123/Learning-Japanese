Let\u2019s take a closer look.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kana\">Hiragana and Katakana<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Collectively called \u201ckana\u201d, hiragana and katakana are two separate, phonetic sets of characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being \u201cphonetic\u201d means that each character represents a particular sound, and each character is always pronounced the same way (with a few exceptions). See <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/pronunciation\/\">my article on pronunciation<\/a> for a more detailed explanation of all the sounds and sound combinations in Japanese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is both a hiragana and a katakana character for each and every unique sound in Japanese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the \u201ca\u201d sound is written like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>&#8220;a&#8221; sound character<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-regular\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Hiragana<\/td><td>\u3042<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Katakana<\/td><td>\u30a2<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the full list for both:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"748\" height=\"820\" src=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Kana-charts.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2790\" srcset=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Kana-charts.png 748w, https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Kana-charts-274x300.png 274w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Since both characters sets have a character for each and every unique sound, <strong>between hiragana and katakana, it is possible to write every single word in Japanese<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, they are not usually interchangeable. The choice of which to use <strong>depends on which type of word is being written<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In essence, there are two types of words in Japanese:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>\u201cNative\u201d Japanese words &#8211; most words fall into this category<\/li><li>Loanwords &#8211; that is, words borrowed from other languages (most of which are from English)<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Native Japanese words<\/strong> can all be represented in writing using <strong>hiragana<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Loanwords <\/strong>can all be represented in writing using <strong>katakana<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the word \u201ckarate\u201d &#8211; a native Japanese word &#8211; is written in hiragana using the characters \u201cka\u201d, \u201cra\u201d and \u201cte\u201d:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rw-indent\" style=\"font-size: 36px\"><p><ruby>\u304b<rt>ka<\/rt>\u3089<rt>ra<\/rt>\u3066<rt>te<\/rt><\/ruby><\/p><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, \u201ckamera\u201d, the Japanese word for \u201ccamera\u201d, is written using katakana since it has clearly been borrowed from English:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rw-indent\" style=\"font-size: 36px\"><p><ruby>\u30ab<rt>ka<\/rt>\u30e1<rt>me<\/rt>\u30e9<rt>ra<\/rt><\/ruby><\/p><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\u2019s really that simple:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>If a word has been borrowed from another language, it is typically written in katakana.<\/li><li>Otherwise, it <em>can<\/em> be written in hiragana.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two main exceptions to this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Katakana is used for some animals and birds, which often have quite complex kanji but are instead written in katakana, even though they are \u201cnative\u201d Japanese words. &#8220;Frog&#8221;, for example, is &#8220;kaeru&#8221;, which is usually written in katakana (\u30ab\u30a8\u30eb) even though it is a native Japanese word that can be written in kanji (\u86d9).<\/li><li>Katakana is sometimes used for native words in order to add emphasis, particularly in advertising. It&#8217;s kind of like a Japanese version of writing in ALL CAPS.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kanji\">Kanji<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kanji are Chinese characters adapted and applied to Japanese. They are generally only used for native Japanese words.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember how we said all native Japanese words can be written in hiragana? Well&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rw-indent\"><strong>The majority of native Japanese words can also be written using kanji<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings us back to our obvious statement from earlier:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rw-indent\">Characters are a way to represent words in writing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kanji simply gives us another way, in addition to hiragana, of writing most native Japanese words. For example, we saw earlier that \u201ckarate\u201d can be written in hiragana, like so:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rw-indent\" style=\"font-size: 36px\"><p><ruby>\u304b<rt>ka<\/rt>\u3089<rt>ra<\/rt>\u3066<rt>te<\/rt><\/ruby><\/p><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it can also be written using kanji:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rw-indent\" style=\"font-size: 36px\"><p><ruby>\u7a7a<rt>ka ra<\/rt>\u624b<rt>te<\/rt><\/ruby><\/p><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The way this is normally discussed is that every kanji has a &#8220;reading&#8221; &#8211; a way of pronouncing it &#8211; which can be written in hiragana.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as an example, the reading of &#8220;\u7a7a\u624b&#8221; is &#8220;\u304b\u3089\u3066&#8221;, or &#8220;karate&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"readings\">Kanji readings and &#8220;furigana&#8221;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, kanji words are written with &#8220;furigana&#8221;, which is the hiragana reading on top of the kanji. Here is the word &#8220;karate&#8221; written in kanji with furigana:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rw-indent\" style=\"font-size: 36px\"><p><ruby>\u7a7a<rt>\u304b\u3089<\/rt><\/ruby> <ruby>\u624b<rt>\u3066<\/rt><\/ruby><\/p><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Furigana is used, for example, when a kanji character or word is particularly rare, or has an irregular reading. Books and other material aimed at Japanese children and, to a lesser extent, teenagers, will also usually include a lot of furigana to ensure they can read the material.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, each sound that makes up a word is attributed to one of the kanji characters. For &#8220;karate&#8221;, the reading of the first kanji (meaning &#8220;empty&#8221;) is &#8220;kara&#8221;, while the reading of the second kanji (meaning &#8220;hand&#8221;) is &#8220;te&#8221;. These combine, of course, to form the word, &#8220;karate&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also a few words with irregular readings where the reading applies to the word as a whole, so each sound can&#8217;t really be allocated to a particular character. An example of this is the word for &#8220;today&#8221;:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rw-indent\">today<br>\u4eca\u65e5<br>\u304d\u3087\u3046<br>ky\u014d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is made of the characters meaning &#8220;now&#8221; and &#8220;day&#8221;, but the reading, &#8220;ky\u014d&#8221;, can&#8217;t be divided and attributed to each of the kanji. It simply needs to be viewed as a whole, like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rw-indent\" style=\"font-size: 36px\"><p><ruby>\u4eca\u65e5<rt>\u304d\u3087\u3046<\/rt><\/ruby><\/p><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>FYI, the Kana + Kanji Edition of <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/\">my book, 80\/20 Japanese<\/a>, includes furigana for all words written in kanji throughout the book to ensure you can see the &#8220;natural&#8221; Japanese, but are also able to read it even if you don&#8217;t recognize the kanji.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group rw-sidebar\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiple-readings\">Most Kanji have multiple possible readings<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Where kanji gets particularly tricky is that most kanji have more than one reading, so the same kanji will be pronounced differently in different words. This seems like a recipe for pure confusion, but it&#8217;s not as bad as it sounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without going into too much detail, the vast majority of kanji have only a couple of different readings, and they are usually predictable based on how they are used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What trips up most people is that some kanji &#8211; particularly many of the most common ones &#8211; have a LOT of different readings. The secret here is that <strong>one or two of those readings will be far more common than the others<\/strong>, with the rest only appearing in one or two words. What&#8217;s more, those exceptions tend to be either in really common words (making them easy to remember), or extremely uncommon words (so you don&#8217;t need to bother with them).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, I strongly recommend a vocabulary-first approach to learning kanji. That is, learn vocabulary you will need and use, then learn the kanji that represents them. <strong>Forget about the other readings of those kanji until you learn a useful word that uses them.<\/strong> If you don&#8217;t know any words that apply a particular reading, that reading is next to useless to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why the <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/#anki-flashcards\">Anki flashcard pack that accompanies my book<\/a> has a deck of kanji-based words focused on learning to read whole words written in kanji, rather than paying special attention to the individual characters themselves.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hiragana-or-kanji\">When to use Hiragana, and when to use Kanji<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, <strong>most words that can be written in kanji usually are written in kanji.<\/strong> That means a word like \u201ckarate\u201d will virtually always be written in kanji.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, there are effectively three types of native Japanese words when it comes to their written representation:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Whole word usually written in kanji<\/li><li>Part of the word usually written in kanji, part written in hiragana<\/li><li>Whole word always written in hiragana<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s look closer at each of these.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"all-kanji\">Whole word usually written in kanji<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This type is simple as it is exactly as described &#8211; that is, the whole word is usually written entirely in kanji.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cKarate\u201d is an example of this type. Most nouns also fit into this category since they only have one form (ie. they don&#8217;t <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/verb-tense-cheat-sheet\/\">conjugate like verbs<\/a>), so their pronunciation is always the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"part-kanji\">Part of the word usually written in kanji, part written in hiragana<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Many words, particularly verbs and adjectives, are typically written as a combination of kanji and hiragana. This is because only part of the word can be written in kanji.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the verb meaning \u201cgo\u201d is \u201cikimasu\u201d in the polite form. In hiragana only, this would be:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rw-indent\" style=\"font-size: 36px\"><p><ruby>\u3044<rt>i<\/rt>\u304d<rt>ki<\/rt>\u307e<rt>ma<\/rt>\u3059<rt>su<\/rt><\/ruby><\/p><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this will normally be written like so:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rw-indent\" style=\"font-size: 36px\"><p><strong><ruby>\u884c<rt>i<\/rt><\/ruby><\/strong><ruby>\u304d<rt>ki<\/rt>\u307e<rt>ma<\/rt>\u3059<rt>su<\/rt><\/ruby><\/p><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The kanji, \u884c, only accounts for the part that is read as the \u201ci\u201d sound at the beginning. The rest of the word can\u2019t be written in kanji, so it is always written in hiragana.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For grammatical reasons, all verbs that have kanji are like this &#8211; that is, they have part of the word that must always be written in hiragana. Many adjectives and <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/japanese-adverbs\/\">adverbs<\/a> are similar. Let&#8217;s see:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The adjective \u201cnew\u201d:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rw-indent\"><strong>\u65b0<\/strong>\u3057\u3044<br><strong>\u3042\u305f\u3089<\/strong>\u3057\u3044<br><strong>atara<\/strong>sh\u012b<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The adverb \u201cnewly\u201d:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rw-indent\"><strong>\u65b0<\/strong>\u3057\u304f<br><strong>\u3042\u305f\u3089<\/strong>\u3057\u304f<br><strong>atara<\/strong>shiku<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also a few words that have hiragana sitting between two kanji. There are not nearly as many of these as the others, but they do exist, like this one:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rw-indent\">food<br><strong>\u98df<\/strong>\u3079<strong>\u7269<\/strong><br><strong>\u305f<\/strong>\u3079<strong>\u3082\u306e<\/strong><br><strong>ta<\/strong>be<strong>mono<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combines the stem of the verb for \u201ceat\u201d (tabemasu) with the word meaning \u201cthing\u201d. The \u201cbe\u201d sound is actually part of the stem of that verb, and is always written in hiragana there too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group rw-sidebar\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More about the readings of kanji in verbs<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>When conjugating verbs, it is almost always the non-kanji part that is changed, so the reading of the kanji part of a verb is <em>usually<\/em> the same, regardless of <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/verb-tense-cheat-sheet\/\">verb tense or form<\/a>. For example, here is the plain\/dictionary form of &#8220;ikimasu&#8221;, meaning &#8220;go&#8221;:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rw-indent\">go (plain form)<br><strong>\u884c<\/strong>\u304f<br><strong>\u3044<\/strong>\u304f<br><strong>i<\/strong>ku<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the polite form, the kanji represents the \u201ci\u201d sound, and the rest of the word is written in hiragana.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">One major exception<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>However, one of the most common verbs &#8211; &#8220;kimasu&#8221;, meaning &#8220;come&#8221; &#8211; breaks this rule.

This (as well as the same verb in its other forms) is virtually always written in hiragana, like so:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rw-indent\">can do<br>\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059<br>dekimasu<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it does have kanji:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rw-indent\">can do<br>\u51fa\u6765\u307e\u3059<br>dekimasu<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Individually, these kanji are both very common. The first is from the verb \u201cdemasu\u201d, meaning \u201cto leave, go out, or appear in\u201d, while the second is from the verb \u201ckimasu\u201d, meaning &#8220;come&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this, the word \u201cdekimasu\u201d is basically always written in hiragana. The reason is because it has actually been <strong>officially designated to be written in hiragana<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are literally thousands of unique kanji characters, but there is an official list of \u201cjoy\u014d kanji\u201d &#8211; kanji for common use &#8211; which outlines which characters should be taught in schools and used in official government documents. It lists 2136 different characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a link to the official searchable list (in Japanese, of course):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bunka.go.jp\/kokugo_nihongo\/sisaku\/joho\/joho\/kijun\/naikaku\/kanji\/joyokanjisakuin\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/www.bunka.go.jp\/kokugo_nihongo\/sisaku\/joho\/joho\/kijun\/naikaku\/kanji\/joyokanjisakuin\/index.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lesser-known fact is that there is an annex to the list that essentially explains the general rules for kanji usage. Among other things, it also lists some exceptions &#8211; words that should be written in hiragana, even though the kanji that make them up are included in the list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDekiru\u201d &#8211; the plain form of \u201cdekimasu\u201d &#8211; appears as a specific example of a word that should, in general, always be written in hiragana. Here\u2019s a snippet with the relevant part:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"573\" height=\"240\" src=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/joyo-kanji-exceptions.png\" alt=\"\u3067\u304d\u308b should be written in hiragana\" class=\"wp-image-2789\" srcset=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/joyo-kanji-exceptions.png 573w, https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/joyo-kanji-exceptions-300x126.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px\" \/><figcaption>Source (PDF): <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bunka.go.jp\/kokugo_nihongo\/sisaku\/joho\/joho\/kijun\/naikaku\/pdf\/joyokanjihyobesi_20101130.pdf\">https:\/\/www.bunka.go.jp\/kokugo_nihongo\/sisaku\/joho\/joho\/kijun\/naikaku\/pdf\/joyokanjihyobesi_20101130.pdf<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s certainly no need to memorize all of the rules and exceptions, but it does explain why you might occasionally see a word that you think should be written in kanji but isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s not entirely random.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group rw-sidebar\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-kanji\">Why do we need kanji if everything can be written in hiragana?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, kanji is far more efficient and, surprisingly, easier to read &#8211; once you can read it, that is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An example will help demonstrate this. Here\u2019s a sentence from Chapter 10 of <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/\">my book, 80\/20 Japanese<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rw-indent\">I forgot that Honda-san is going to Sapporo today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here it is with the natural use of kanji.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rw-indent\">\u79c1\u306f\u3001\u4eca\u65e5\u672c\u7530\u3055\u3093\u304c\u672d\u5e4c\u306b\u884c\u304f\u306e\u3092\u5fd8\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here it is in all hiragana:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rw-indent\">\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306f\u3001\u304d\u3087\u3046\u307b\u3093\u3060\u3055\u3093\u304c\u3055\u3063\u307d\u308d\u306b\u3044\u304f\u306e\u3092\u308f\u3059\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The all-hiragana version is obviously longer, but worse than that, since Japanese doesn\u2019t put spaces between words, the hiragana-only sentence is just one big blur of characters. Therearenonaturalbreakstomakereadingeasier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With kanji, however, since most words that are written in kanji usually <em>start<\/em> with kanji, and most sentence elements are marked by particles that are always written in hiragana, it\u2019s usually easy to know where each word begins and ends.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kana-kanji-summary\">Summary of Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this all might sound confusing, but it\u2019s actually quite straightforward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s summarize:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Loanwords (words borrowed from other languages) are written in katakana.<\/li><li>Native Japanese words can all be written in hiragana.<\/li><li>Of the native words in Japanese, some have kanji, and some don\u2019t.<\/li><li>When a word can be written in kanji, it usually is, whether that&#8217;s the whole word or only part of it.<\/li><li>Some native words simply can\u2019t be written in kanji, so they are always written in hiragana.<\/li><li>There are also a few exceptions where hiragana is just preferred, even though kanji exists.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"romaji\">Romaji<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For the sake of clearing up any confusion, let&#8217;s finish things off by talking about Romaji.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, <strong>Romaji is Japanese written phonetically in Latin script (English letters)<\/strong>. Its main use is to help people who can\u2019t read Japanese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It does have a few other practical uses, however. For example:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>It is sometimes used for emphasis in things like advertising and other signage<\/li><li>It is used for some acronyms, particularly ones imported from English like \u201cDVD\u201d and \u201cATM\u201d<\/li><li>It allows Japanese to be typed using an English keyboard<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, Romaji mostly exists to help people who can\u2019t yet read \u201creal\u201d Japanese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does that mean you should avoid using it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Romaji is best thought of as a tool. It is extremely helpful for bridging the gap between zero understanding of Japanese and full reading ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s obviously great for tourists who visit Japan, as most signs with place names (train stations, highways, etc.) have romaji next to the native Japanese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also great, for example, if you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/\">learn to speak Japanese quickly<\/a> without worrying about learning to read and write just yet. There\u2019s no shame in this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you start learning Japanese, there is a lot of new information to learn &#8211; pronunciation, vocabulary, an unfamiliar grammar system, three new sets of characters&#8230; Romaji can make it all feel a bit less overwhelming, and allow you to get some early wins on your journey to speaking Japanese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group rw-sidebar\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Note that it is Romaji, NOT \u201cRomanji\u201d. There is no \u201cn\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Japanese, it is written like so:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rw-indent\" style=\"font-size: 36px\"><p><ruby>\u30ed\u30fc\u30de<rt>r\u014dma<\/rt>\u5b57<rt>ji<\/rt><\/ruby><\/p><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is, literally, \u201cr\u014dma\u201d, meaning \u201cRome\u201d, plus the kanji for \u201ccharacter\u201d, which is pronounced \u201cji\u201d. Combined, this is pronounced \u201cr\u014dmaji\u201d, meaning \u201cRoman characters\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To say \u201cRomanji\u201d is to convert the word \u201cRome\u201d into a different form in English, even though this type of conversion isn\u2019t needed in Japanese. It\u2019s essentially applying English grammar rules to a Japanese word.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-to-learn\">What should I learn, and when?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you hopefully have a clear understanding of the different types of characters that make up the Japanese writing system, you&#8217;re probably wondering when the best time to learn them is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/when-to-learn-japanese-characters\/\">Click here to continue to the next article, <strong>Should you learn Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji?
