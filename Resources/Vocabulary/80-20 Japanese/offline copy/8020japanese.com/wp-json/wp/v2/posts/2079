However, if you encounter it again a few minutes later, and then again a few days later, then a week later, and so on, it will quickly find its way into your long-term memory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"217\" src=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/00-spaced-repetition-1024x217.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2111\" srcset=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/00-spaced-repetition-1024x217.png 1024w, https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/00-spaced-repetition-300x63.png 300w, https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/00-spaced-repetition-768x162.png 768w, https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/00-spaced-repetition.png 1366w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Spaced repetition exploits our brain\u2019s preference for remembering\nuseful things by forcing us to re-encounter information we are trying to\nremember at just the right time to help us permanently remember it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This helps us overcome some of the biggest challenges of learning a language, such as information overload, being unable to keep up with the pace of the language in the wild, or simply not having enough direct exposure to the language in the first place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are countless tools and programs that incorporate\nspaced repetition, but one of the most popular and versatile is Anki.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-anki\"><strong>What is Anki?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Anki is a digital flashcard app that uses spaced repetition to make remembering things easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you study with Anki, the app automatically cycles\nthrough your flashcards and shows you a mix of new and old material each day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, one day, a flashcard saying \u201ckenchiku \/ \u3051\u3093\u3061\u304f\u201d might show up for the first time. At this stage, you probably wouldn\u2019t know it yet, so you would reveal the answer to find out it means \u201carchitecture\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, a little bit later, you\u2019ll see it again, only this time you\u2019re more likely to know the answer. Anki will then show it to you again and again at increasingly spaced intervals until it\u2019s etched in your memory permanently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, Anki shows you what to study and when in such a way that maximizes the amount of information you can memorize.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anki isn\u2019t used exclusively for languages, though that is one of its most common applications. The app itself is highly flexible and allows you to make any kind of flashcard you can dream up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the remainder of this article, I\u2019m going to show you two\nthings:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>How to use Anki, including how to make your own\nflashcards<\/li><li>The types of flashcards you can make\nspecifically for Japanese (hint: it\u2019s not just vocabulary)<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the article, you\u2019ll also find a sample set of Anki flashcards that you can import into Anki and get started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-use-anki\"><strong>How to use Anki<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, if you&#8217;re going to use Anki, you will obviously need to download and install it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow these links to get the mobile app for <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"iOS (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/ankimobile-flashcards\/id373493387\" target=\"_blank\">iOS<\/a> or <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Android (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.ichi2.anki\" target=\"_blank\">Android<\/a>, or the desktop versions for <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Windows, Mac and Linux (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/apps.ankiweb.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows, Mac and Linux<\/a>. There is also an online app that you can use in your browser (no download required) called <a href=\"https:\/\/ankiweb.net\/\">AnkiWeb<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only one of these that is not free is the iOS version, which is a paid app. Purchases of the app support Anki&#8217;s future development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve downloaded and installed the app on your device of choice, the next step is to fill it with flashcards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Anki app itself doesn\u2019t come with any flashcards built in, so you have two main options for dealing with that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Create your own<\/li><li>Download one of the publicly shared sets\navailable on AnkiWeb<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s look at how to do each of these. The steps I will show you are for the Windows version of Anki, but they are much the same for the other platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If at any point you get stuck or want to do something a little different, check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.ankiweb.net\/docs\/manual.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"official Anki manual (opens in a new tab)\">official Anki manual<\/a> &#8211; it&#8217;s extremely thorough and easy to follow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"make-flashcards\"><strong>How to make your own Anki flashcards<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating your own flashcards can be done one of two ways:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>In the app<\/li><li>Creating a list externally and importing it<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The latter is far more efficient for creating larger\nflashcard sets, but we\u2019ll look at both nonetheless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get into that, however, there&#8217;s an important concept I need to explain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anki was designed quite cleverly to keep \u201cCards\u201d and \u201cNotes\u201d as separate things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Notes <\/strong>are the question\/answer pairs with the information you want to learn<\/li><li><strong>Cards <\/strong>are the flashcards that show the information contained in the Notes<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This separation is beneficial because it means you can have a single Note and display it in multiple different ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, let\u2019s say you have a note like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rw-indent\">\n<p><strong>Front:<\/strong> kenchiku \/ \u3051\u3093\u3061\u304f<\/p>\n<p><strong>Back:<\/strong> architecture <\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This single Note could be turned into two separate Cards \u2013 one as described above, and one with the front and back reversed like so:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rw-indent\">\n<p><strong>Front:<\/strong> architecture<\/p>\n<p><strong>Back:<\/strong> kenchiku \/ \u3051\u3093\u3061\u304f<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to this, we can create, for example, vocabulary Cards for both recognition (\u201cwhat does this Japanese word mean?\u201d) and production (\u201chow do you say __ in Japanese?\u201d) by creating just a single Note.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that that\u2019s cleared up, let\u2019s get look at how we can\ncreate Notes and Cards inside the Anki app. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"create-deck\"><strong>Creating a new deck in Anki<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A fresh installation of Anki includes a Default deck, but to create a new deck, simply click \u201cCreate Deck\u201d, give it a name, and press OK. Easy. You should now have something like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"541\" height=\"457\" src=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/01-deck-created.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2092\" srcset=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/01-deck-created.png 541w, https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/01-deck-created-300x253.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>If the Default deck is empty, it will disappear from the\nhome screen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"create-in-app\"><strong>Creating Anki flashcards in the app<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1:<\/strong> On the Anki home screen, click &#8220;Add&#8221;.

Since it&#8217;s free, let\u2019s do it using Google Sheets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"create-text\"><strong>Creating Anki flashcards using Google Sheets<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1:<\/strong> Create a new Google Sheet, and rename it to something meaningful. If you don&#8217;t have a Google account or use Google Sheets, you will either need to create one, or use another program that you do have access to. Either way, most steps will be the same or very similar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2:<\/strong> Next, we simply add all of the words we want on our flashcards in two columns \u2013 one for the front, and one for the back. Let\u2019s do that with the days of the week:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"392\" src=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/07-days-of-week.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2097\" srcset=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/07-days-of-week.png 500w, https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/07-days-of-week-300x235.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll put the Japanese word in the first column so that, when this is converted into a Note with two Cards (one for each direction), the recognition Card (ie. Japanese to English) will be first. This is better, because recognition is easier than production and can therefore work as a stepping stone to production.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, if you want to use hiragana or kanji instead, you can do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rw-sidebar\">\n<p><strong>Tip:<\/strong>\nIf you\u2019re using romaji and you need to get the elongated vowel sounds, you\ncan\u2019t enter them directly in Google Sheets.

Booyah!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we know how to make flashcards for Anki, let\u2019s look at the different types of flashcards that you can make to dramatically enhance your Japanese learning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"flashcards-to-make\"><strong>Flashcards to make for learning Japanese<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people probably imagine that vocabulary and characters (especially kanji) are the two main things that you would use Anki for, and they\u2019d be right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are other things you can do that can really help you build your Japanese skills. There are also some pitfalls to watch out for when creating your own flashcards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s look at a few of our options, including the obvious ones,\nand what we can do to make our flashcards as effective as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"vocab\">Flashcards for <strong>vocabulary<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For vocabulary, we absolutely want to make sure we make flashcards for both directions &#8211; that is, for recognizing Japanese words, and for producing Japanese words based on (usually) the English word we want to say.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When doing this, however, it is important to keep in mind that both languages have many homonyms &#8211; words that sound the same but have different meanings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not an unsolvable problem at all, but when making your vocabulary flashcards, be sure to take these into account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kana\">Flashcards for learning h<strong>iragana and katakana<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s more difficult to test your ability to write characters with Anki, since the app doesn\u2019t have stroke recognition capabilities, but it can certainly be used for character recognition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For hiragana and katakana, I recommend two types of\nflashcards:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Individual characters (including small ya-line combinations like \u201ckya \/ \u304d\u3083\u201d)<\/li><li>Whole words written in hiragana and katakana<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The former is obvious, but the latter is just as important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we read (in any language), our brains don\u2019t process letters individually; we process words as a whole. Practicing doing this exact thing will help speed up your ability to do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can, of course, be achieved simply using your vocabulary flashcards, but I recommend focused kana reading practice to improve your ability to parse words written in these characters more quickly. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kanji\">Flashcards for learning <strong>kanji<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For kanji, you may worry that you can&#8217;t really practice writing the characters in Anki, but in my opinion, this is a non-issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Handwriting of kanji is nowhere near as useful a skill as it used to be. In a digital world, for most purposes \u2013 even writing (ie. typing) \u2013 you only actually need to be able to recognize kanji, not write them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It therefore makes more sense to focus almost entirely on recognition, as this reduced workload will allow you to learn more characters quickly. Anki is perfect for that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of flashcards, I recommend focusing your study on <strong>whole words written in kanji<\/strong>, rather than the individual characters and their multitude of readings and English meanings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? Because if you see a kanji in the real world, it won\u2019t be hanging out by itself asking you to list all its readings and possible uses; it will be as part of a word.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning individual kanji and all their readings is a bit\nlike learning Latin when your goal is to learn Italian. It\u2019s a worthy endeavour\nin its own right if it interests you, and certainly beneficial to your\nunderstanding of Latin-derived languages in general, but you\u2019ll learn Italian\nmuch faster if you just learn Italian directly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, if you want to be a kanji expert that can recite all the readings and details of each and every kanji, go ahead and learn them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, learn kanji as words, because that\u2019s the only form in which you will ever need to actually read or write them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My recommendation therefore is to make flashcards with something like this on the Front:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"402\" height=\"366\" src=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/15-kanji-front.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2104\" srcset=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/15-kanji-front.png 402w, https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/15-kanji-front-300x273.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>And with an answer that looks something like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"402\" height=\"366\" src=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/16-kanji-back.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2105\" srcset=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/16-kanji-back.png 402w, https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/16-kanji-back-300x273.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This flashcard will teach you how to read a useful word, and without thinking about it you will also learnt the on-yomi (&#8220;Chinese&#8221; reading) of two separate kanji, as well as their rough individual meanings in English. Everything you need, with no waste.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus on reading, and focus on words. That\u2019s how kanji are\nused in real life, so that\u2019s what you want to learn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"verbs\">Flashcards for mastering <strong>verb conjugations<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, the first verb tenses people learn are the polite ones, and these are very easy to conjugate since they all end in a simple variation of \u300c\uff5e\u307e\u3059\u300d, like \u300c\uff5e\u307e\u3057\u305f\u300d (past tense) or \u300c\uff5e\u307e\u305b\u3093\u300d (negative).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, however, when you learn informal verb tenses and the te-form, things start to get tricky.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are very clear rules for converting to these tenses (all covered in <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/\">my book<\/a>), but ultimately, you need to be so familiar with these verb tenses that it is better to memorize them as if they are new vocabulary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may seem odd, but it\u2019s not new to you \u2013 not even close.\nConsider this\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s the past tense of \u201cplay\u201d?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPlayed\u201d, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you think, \u201coh, well this is regular English verb and it\nends in a consonant, so we just add \u201ced\u201d to get the past tense\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course not. You just knew, because you\u2019ve memorized it. Just how you&#8217;ve memorized that the past tense of &#8220;go&#8221; is &#8220;went&#8221;, not &#8220;goed&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>That is the trick to mastering Japanese verb tenses.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning the conversion rules is important, too, as it\nallows you to convert new words you may not have memorized (yet), plus it\nallows you to self-correct if you find yourself mis-remembering or unsure of a\nparticular tense. Don\u2019t skip this step.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But ultimately, when you are fluent in Japanese, you will have remembered most verbs you know in a variety of verb tenses whether you actively try to or not. Just like you have done for English.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Verb tense flashcards in Anki can speed that process up dramatically, and <strong>get you over the hump from fumbling for the right conversion to just knowing the right verb form every time<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, like vocabulary, both recognition and production are\nimportant, so make flashcards for both. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are any number of flashcard configurations you can\ncome up with for learning the various verb tenses. Here are some that I\nrecommend, shown as question-answer pairs:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Polite present\/future tense (masu) \u2194 Informal present\/future tense (AKA plain\/dictionary form)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rw-indent\">\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong> asobimasu \u2194 asobu<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Polite past tense  \u2194  informal past tense<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rw-indent\">\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong> asobimashita \u2194 asonda<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Polite negative form  \u2194  informal negative form<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rw-indent\">\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong> asobimasen \u2194 asobanai<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Polite present\/future tense (masu)  \u2194  Potential \u201ccan do\u201d form (polite or informal)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rw-indent\">\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong> asobimasu \u2194 asobemasu<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Polite present\/future (masu)  \u2194  Te-Form<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rw-indent\">\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong> asobimasu \u2194 asonde<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>(For more on verb tenses and forms, check out my <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/verb-tense-cheat-sheet\/\">Japanese Verb Tense Cheat Sheet<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve completed the above for a decent number of verbs, all of the other verb endings out there will be a breeze, and you&#8217;ll instinctively be much better at conjugating new verbs you don&#8217;t know yet too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few things to watch out for here:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>As with vocabulary, beware of duplicates\/homonyms.<\/li><li>Avoid using kanji as a way to cheat. Knowing a kanji will allow you to recognize a verb based solely on the kanji, even if you don\u2019t recognize the verb in the given tense, so recognition flashcards should use romaji or hiragana only.<\/li><li>Make sure you know what form you are converting to. A flashcard that just says \u201cshimasu\u201d means nothing, so be sure provide hints telling you the target tense or form.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sentences\">Flashcards featuring w<strong>hole phrases and sentences<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an area where I believe Anki can really be used not\nso much for memorization, but for another purpose:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Automated, integrated grammar and vocabulary exercises to practice building and understanding sentences.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can create flashcards that include complete sentences, then you can effectively test your ability to recognize and apply any and all grammar concepts in a practical way, as well as use the vocabulary you know in context.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is much more effective than simply memorizing grammar rules. Like with verb tenses, remembering the laws of the language is valuable, but taking a fundamental understanding and then practicing it a gazillion times will do much more for your ability to apply those laws on the fly in conversation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important, however, to have enough sentences that you\ndon\u2019t find yourself simply memorizing the sentences as a whole. The goal is to\npractice applying grammar concepts \u2013 using the right particles, verb tenses,\ncombining words to form more complex phrases, etc. If you have too few\nsentences testing your knowledge, you run the risk of simply memorizing the\nanswers, rather than the grammar concepts applied within.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are to create flashcards using sentences, here are a couple of suggestions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>For production, beware of multiple possible answers. Many things can be said several different ways, so even if you don\u2019t include the alternatives in the answers, be aware that your answer may be right, even if it doesn\u2019t match exactly. This in itself can be a good test of your knowledge.<\/li><li> At least partially learn vocabulary separately, or avoid adding too much new vocabulary all at once. Ideally you only want to be learning or testing your knowledge of one new thing at a time, so loading up sentences of unfamiliar vocabulary will make it much more challenging and distract you from the real goal \u2013 sentence building and interpretation.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Compiling sentences to use in your flashcards is relatively more difficult than other types we&#8217;ve discussed, but well worth it in my opinion as it tests one of the most difficult-to-practice, yet vitally important skills &#8211; sentence building.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group rw-sidebar\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Don&#8217;t have time to make all these yourself?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s cool &#8211; I&#8217;ve done it for you \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/#anki-flashcards\">80\/20 Japanese Anki Pack<\/a><\/strong> has 7000+ flashcards covering all of the above, and all work perfectly alongside the comprehensive grammar lessons in my book, <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/\">80\/20 Japanese<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/#anki-flashcards\">Click here to learn more.<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no doubt other creative ways that you can make flashcards for Anki, and Anki also has<a href=\"https:\/\/apps.ankiweb.net\/docs\/manual.html\"> a lot of options and features<\/a> I haven\u2019t mentioned, but hopefully the above has shown you enough to get set up and start using it yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it\u2019s time to actually do it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your action items<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Download and install Anki from <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.ankiweb.net\/\">this page<\/a>.<\/li><li>Make a deck for the things that you are currently trying to learn.
