I&#8217;m Richa<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">r<\/span>d Webb. Author. Fluent Japanese Speaker.<\/strong>I learned Japanese the way most people do &#8211; through formal classes, lots of textbooks and sheer force of will. Even though I eventually achieved fluency (I have passed the highest level of the Japanese Level Proficiency Test (JLPT) and have worked for two Japanese companies with virtually all communication in Japanese), for years I looked back at my experiences and wondered why it felt so incredibly hard to learn Japanese at the time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Japanese shouldn&#8217;t feel like a confusing mess &#8211; because it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s an incredibly logical, intuitive and flexible language. It just happens to be very different from English.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There is a way to break down the barriers that stop most of us from properly learning the language. I was lucky enough to have the time and opportunities to crack that code and I want to share that with you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Hi! I&#8217;m Richa<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">r<\/span>d Webb.&nbsp;<\/strong>Japan and the Japanese language have been a huge part of my life. I first went to live in Japan when I was 15, and have since spent over 6 years living in the country. I have a degree in Japanese, studied linguistics at a Japanese university, passed the highest level of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT), and worked for two Japanese companies where virtually all communication was in Japanese.It was a long road and it wasn&#8217;t always easy, but learning to speak Japanese has been one of the best things I&#8217;ve ever done. It&#8217;s opened many doors, and allowed me to have some amazing experiences.I hope that this book helps you get as much out of Japan and Japanese culture as I have.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(42, 74, 118); font-family: Hind; font-size: 55px; font-weight: 300;\"><strong>FAQs<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Here are the answers to the most frequently asked questions:<\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;; font-weight: 400;\">Which edition should I get?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p style=\"\">All packages include both editions of the eBook, but if you want to get a physical copy (and only one), and can&#8217;t decide which is best, ask yourself one questions:<\/p>\n<p style=\"\">Do I ultimately want to be able to read and write Japanese?<\/p>\n<p style=\"\">If so, the Kana + Kanji Edition will probably be better in the long run. It will likely be more challenging at the beginning, especially if you are not yet familiar with hiragana, but as you progress through the book and your reading skills improve, the Kana + Kanji Edition will actually become easier to read. Plus, you always have the Romaji Edition eBook to fall back on if it becomes a bit too much while you&#8217;re still getting used to the characters.<\/p>\n<p style=\"\">If, however, you are mainly only interested in learning to speak and understand spoken Japanese, the Romaji Edition will be much easier to work with as you will have one less (very large) obstacle in your way.<\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;; font-weight: 400;\">Which package should I get?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p style=\"\">This really just depends on two things &#8211; your budget, and how you like to learn. I can&#8217;t tell you your budget, but I can try to address the other point.<\/p>\n<p style=\"\">Some people like physical, paper books because they find it easier to take notes and flip between pages. If that&#8217;s you, you&#8217;ll probably appreciate a physical copy. If, on the other hand, you&#8217;re happy reading on your smartphone, tablet, computer or other e-reader, then the eBook should do the job &#8211; the content is the same.<\/p>\n<p style=\"\">The Audiobook and Audiobook Remix are popular with people who like to learn or revise lessons while driving, sitting on a bumpy bus, or even as they go to sleep. Others just like having audio of the Japanese example sentences and exercises so they know how everything is supposed to sound.<\/p>\n<p style=\"\">Anki is a great way to revise and commit to memory all of the vocabulary, characters and grammar covered in the book. If you want to be able to pull out your phone and study a little when you have a few spare minutes, or use of your commute to easily practice what you have learnt in the book, the Anki Pack makes this easy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"\">If you&#8217;re still not sure, then it may help to know that <strong><em>you can upgrade later<\/em><\/strong> without re-purchasing what you already have.

Quantity is important too, but a good base makes it much easier to learn new words and expressions so that you can actually use them, which also helps with memorization.<\/p>\n<p style=\"\">Bottom line, if you learn everything in 80\/20 Japanese and nothing else, you should be able to pass N4 comfortably, depending on your listening ability. To go from there to N3 and beyond, you would likely need other resources targeted specifically at those exams, but this should be much easier than if you studied only what was necessary to pass N4.<\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;; font-weight: 400;\">What happens after I purchase?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p style=\"\">Once your payment has been processed (usually immediately), you will be re-directed to a web page where you can download the digital files included in your chosen package. You will also receive an email with a link to the download page, as well as a receipt for your purchase.<\/p>\n<p style=\"\">If your package includes a physical book, we will process your order as quickly as possible and send you an email when the book has been dispatched (usually within 2-3 business days).<\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;; font-weight: 400;\">Does the download link expire?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p style=\"\">The download link expires after a period of time and a certain number of download attempts, but this is only to prevent abuse. If you missed the download window, lost the files, or need to access your files again for any other reason, please <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/contact\/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"outline: none;\">contact us<\/a> and we&#8217;ll re-activate your download.<\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;; font-weight: 400;\">Do you ever have sales or offer discounts?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p style=\"\">For existing products, no, we don&#8217;t run sales or discounts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"\">Why?<\/p>\n<p style=\"\">Because if you want to learn or improve your Japanese, <em>now<\/em> is the best time to start. The hope of a sale gives you a reason to wait, and for every day you wait, that is one day lost that you could have spent learning and improving.<\/p>\n<p style=\"\">The price will never be lower than it is right now, so if you want to start, start now and don&#8217;t look back.<\/p>\n<p style=\"\">The only time we ever intend on having a sale is when releasing a new product, but this won&#8217;t affect the price of existing products.<\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;; font-weight: 400;\">Is there a student or military discount available?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p style=\"\">Sorry, no, but we can offer a bulk discount if purchasing a large number of copies for a class of students or study group. If this interests you, please <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/contact\/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"outline: none;\">contact us<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;; font-weight: 400;\">How much do the packages cost in other currencies?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p style=\"\">All sales are processed in US dollars or Euros, and this will be converted to your local currency by your bank or credit card issuer using their exchange rate at the time of purchase.<\/p>\n<p style=\"\">For a rough estimate of the amount you will be charged in your currency, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xe.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"outline: none;\">http:\/\/www.xe.com\/<\/a>.
