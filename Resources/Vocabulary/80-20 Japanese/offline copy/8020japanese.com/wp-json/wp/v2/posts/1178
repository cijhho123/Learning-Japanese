While English only has five <em>vowels<\/em>, they are each pronounced differently when used in different combinations with other letters, bringing the total number of unique vowel sounds up to around 20, depending on a person\u2019s accent. Compared with this, the five sounds in Japanese are easy to learn.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the five vowel sounds:<\/p>\n<p data-css=\"tve-u-1601fff84ef\"><strong>(Click to play audio)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>These five vowels are also the first five \u201cletters\u201d of the &#8220;syllabary&#8221;, the Japanese equivalent of the alphabet. Together, they are often referred to as the \u201ca-line\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>In speech and writing, each of these sounds are used on their own or in combination with consonant sounds to produce other \u201cletters\u201d. For example, the first consonant sound is a \u201ck\u201d sound, but this can only be written or spokenin combination with one of the above five vowel sounds.<\/p>\n<p>As such, the next five \u201cletters\u201d in the syllabary after the a-line are:<\/p>\n<p>As you have probably guessed, these five sounds can be referred to as the \u201cka-line\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to remember that there is no such thing in Japanese as a \u201ck\u201d on its own, and this is the same for all other consonant sounds, with the exception of \u201cn\u201d, as will be explained shortly.<\/p>\n<p>After the ka-line, the pattern continues, starting with \u201csa\u201d and followed by \u201cta\u201d, \u201cna\u201d, \u201cha\u201d, \u201cma\u201d, \u201cya\u201d, \u201cra\u201d and \u201cwa\u201d. There are, however a few exceptions to this basic pattern, so we will now look at each of these lines one by one.<\/p>\n<p>The exception here is that the second sound is \u201cshi\u201d, not \u201csi\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Pro tip: When typing using IME or similar Japanese language input tools, you do not need to type the &#8220;h&#8221; to get \u300c\u3057\u300d &#8211; &#8220;si&#8221; will do the job and save you a fraction of a second. The same goes for other similar exceptions below, such as &#8220;chi&#8221; and &#8220;tsu&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The exceptions here are the \u201ci\u201d and \u201cu\u201d variations, where \u201cti\u201d is pronounced \u201cchi\u201d, and \u201ctu\u201d is pronounced \u201ctsu\u201d, as in the word \u201ctsunami\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>No exceptions here. Next:<\/p>\n<p>The third sound here is not a \u201chu\u201d sound but a \u201cfu\u201d sound, as in Mt. Fuji. It is, however, a lighter sound than the English \u201cf \u201d, and sounds a bit like the sound you might make when unsuccessfully trying to whistle. Your bottom lip should not touch your teeth.<\/p>\n<p>Also, note that \u300c\u306f\u300d is pronounced &#8220;wa&#8221; when used as a particle. This may seem confusing at first, but the particle \u300c\u306f\u300d is so common that it shouldn&#8217;t take long before you are able to recognise when it is a particle and when it is just part of another word. To learn more about particles and the role they play in Japanese sentences, check out my article on <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/japanese-sentence-structure\/\">Japanese sentence structure<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Again, no exceptions. Easy.<\/p>\n<p>The ya-line only has the \u201ca\u201d, \u201cu\u201d, and \u201co\u201d sounds, but is otherwise quite straightforward. The \u201cyi\u201d and \u201cye\u201d sounds were used once upon a time, but have since died out of the language. As a result, the Japanese currency today is pronounced \u201cen\u201d in Japanese, not \u201cyen\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Although there are no exceptions in the ra-line, the &#8220;r&#8221; sound is unquestionably the hardest sound for native English speakers to master. It is usually written as an \u201cR\u201d in romaji, but the sound itself is much lighter than the English \u201cR\u201d, somewhere between an \u201cR\u201d sound and an \u201cL\u201d sound. This is why Japanese people often struggle to distinguish between \u201cR\u201d and \u201cL\u201d when learning English &#8211; they use the same sound to cover both letters when speaking English.<\/p>\n<p>The ra-line sounds are achieved by flicking your tongue lightly against the roof of your mouth. Of course, descriptions like this are hard to implement in practice, so like all other sounds, the best way to learn to pronounce the ra-line correctly is to listen and practice repeatedly until your tongue builds up the necessary muscles to make the sound effortlessly.<\/p>\n<p>Although difficult, this is definitely worth the time, as correct pronunciation of the ra-line will make your Japanese sound <em>much<\/em> better to a native speaker&#8217;s ears, and this alone can earn you lots of respect.<\/p>\n<p>This line only has the \u201ca\u201d and \u201co\u201d variations, and the \u201cw\u201d sound is effectively silent in the case of \u201cwo\u201d. The \u201cwo\u201d therefore sounds the same as the \u201co\u201d from the a-line, but they are used differently in writing and are\u00a0<em>not<\/em> interchangeable. Essentially, &#8220;wo&#8221; is only ever used as a particle, some examples of which can be seen in my other articles, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/japanese-sentence-structure\/\">this one on sentence structure<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/japanese-word-order\/\">this one about word order<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, we have this:<\/p>\n<p>This \u201cn\u201d is the only consonant that stands alone without a vowel sound attached. It is slightly different to the \u201cn\u201d sound produced in the na-line, although you can get away with a regular \u201cn\u201d sound in most cases.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to note that this \u201cn\u201d sound should always be pronounced as its own syllable, and not blended into other sounds. For example, the name \u201cShinichi\u201d is actually made up of the sounds shi-n-i-chi (\u3057\u3093\u3044\u3061), with the \u201cn\u201d sound being the lone \u201cn\u201d, not a part of \u201cni\u201d. This name should therefore be pronounced with a distinct separation of \u201cshin\u201d and \u201cichi\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>There are a few ways to differentiate this \u201cn\u201d sound from na-line sounds when writing in romaji, with my preferred option being \u201cn&#8217;\u201d (\u201cn\u201d followed by an apostrophe). This is only really necessary, however, when the &#8220;n&#8221; is followed by an a-line sound.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, when \u201cn\u201d is followed by a na-line character, it is usually written as \u201cnna\u201d, \u201cnni\u201d, etc., to show that there is an \u201cn\u201d sound followed by a separate na-line sound. For example, the commonly known Japanese word for \u201chello\u201d, sometimes spelled \u201ckonichiwa\u201d, actually contains this \u201cn\u201d followed by \u201cni\u201d, and should therefore be written as \u201ckonnichiwa\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>We have now looked at all of the sounds that appear in the main part of the syllabary, but there are more! There are also a couple of important combinations and other points that are vital to achieving correct pronunciation in Japanese which we will cover soon.<\/p>\n<p>But first, we have to look at&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>Voiced variations<\/h2>\n<p>There is another set of &#8220;letters&#8221; that are strongly related to some of the sounds introduced above as they are, in Japanese terms, simply a transformation of those sounds.<\/p>\n<p>The first line that this applies to is the ka-line. By adding two small lines, known as &#8220;dakuten&#8221; or &#8220;ten-ten&#8221;, to the upper right of each of the ka-line characters, the hard \u201ck\u201d sound changes into a softer \u201cg\u201d sound as follows:<\/p>\n<p>\u304b ka \u2192 \u304c ga\u304d ki \u2192 \u304e gi\u304f ku \u2192 \u3050 gu\u3051 ke \u2192 \u3052 ge\u3053 ko \u2192 \u3054 go<\/p>\n<p>With just two small lines added to each character, we essentially have a new consonant sound.<\/p>\n<p>These altered characters, however, do not appear in the main syllabary, as they are considered simply as variations of the ka-line. Why? Because the \u201ck\u201d sound and the \u201cg\u201d sound are essentially the same except for one small difference &#8211; the \u201cg\u201d sound is voiced, while the \u201ck\u201d sound is not.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not sure what a voiced or unvoiced sound is, say aloud the English \u201ck\u201d sound alone without a vowel, and compare this with what happens when you do the same with an English \u201cg\u201d. You should notice that your mouth moves in much the same way, but while you don\u2019t use your voice for the \u201ck\u201d sound, you do for the \u201cg\u201d. This is because \u201cg\u201d is a voiced consonant, whereas \u201ck\u201d is not.<\/p>\n<p>So, in Japanese, the unvoiced consonant sounds &#8211; that is, all sounds in each of the ka-, sa-, ta- and ha-lines &#8211; can be altered to create a voiced sound that is written in a similar way to their unvoiced counterparts. The other lines (na, ma, ya, ra and wa) don&#8217;t have these because these sounds are already voiced.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, in some cases, words that normally use the unvoiced sound (eg. the \u201ck\u201d sound) use the voiced sound (eg. \u201cg\u201d) instead when combined with other words, as it may be easier to say. For example, the number \u201cthree\u201d is \u201csan\u201d and the word for \u201cfloor\u201d (of a building) is \u201ckai\u201d, yet the third floor could be referred to as \u201csan gai\u201d. This kind of adaptation can be seen all throughout the language.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, like the main sounds, there are a few exceptions among these voiced alternatives, so let&#8217;s look at each line individually.<\/p>\n<p>Like the ka-line itself, these are nice and straightforward.<\/p>\n<p>The one to note here is the second sound, which is pronounced \u201cji\u201d, not \u201czi\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The second sound, \u201cji\u201d, is effectively the same as that from the modified sa-line above, and is rarely used. (If you need to type it, type &#8220;di&#8221;, as typing &#8220;ji&#8221; will usually produce the za-line version).<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cdzu\u201d sound is basically a heavier version of the \u201ctsu\u201d sound where the \u201cdz\u201d is a voiced version of the unvoiced \u201cts\u201d sound. Just be careful, as repeating this sound may lead you towards a career in beat-boxing (sorry&#8230;).<\/p>\n<p>This brings us to the last of these unvoiced sounds, the ha-line. However, this line is unique as it actually has two voiced alternatives &#8211; a \u201cb\u201d sound and a \u201cp\u201d sound.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, the \u201cb\u201d sound is made by adding two lines (dakuten) like the others:<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the \u201cp\u201d sound is achieved by adding a small circle (handakuten, or &#8220;half&#8221; dakuten, since it is considered half-voiced) instead of two lines, as follows:<\/p>\n<p>As you can see, both the \u201cb\u201d and \u201cp\u201d variations of the ha-line are straightforward and don&#8217;t have any special sounds.<\/p>\n<h2>Combining sounds<\/h2>\n<p>We have now covered all of the individual sounds in Japanese (ie. the ones that just use a single kana character). Now let&#8217;s look at a few other sounds that are created by combining sounds together, plus a couple of important points to remember when speaking Japanese.<\/p>\n<h3>Small ya-line combinations<\/h3>\n<p>The three ya-line sounds can be combined with any of the sounds that end in \u201ci\u201d (except for \u201ci\u201d itself from the \u201ca-line\u201d) to produce another variation of sounds.<\/p>\n<p>When written, the ya-line sounds are written smaller than regular characters. For example, \u201cki\u201d + \u201csmall ya\u201d would become \u201ckya\u201d, as if you were saying \u201cki\u201d and then \u201cya\u201d but without the \u201ci\u201d sound.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of the sa-line, \u201cshi\u201d is the character with the \u201ci\u201d sound, so instead of \u201csya\u201d, \u201csyu\u201d and \u201csyo\u201d, combining \u201cshi\u201d with the small ya-line characters produces the sounds \u201csha\u201d, \u201cshu\u201d and \u201csho\u201d. This idea also applies to some other sounds, as you will see below.<\/p>\n<p>Here are all of the small ya-line combination versions of the main sounds:<\/p>\n<p>Plus there are the voiced consonant variations:<\/p>\n<p>Note that when a lone \u201cn\u201d sound is followed by a regular ya-line sound, it may be written in romaji as, for example, \u201cn\u2019ya\u201d or &#8220;nnya&#8221;. These should be pronounced as two separate sounds, and not joined together like the \u201cnya\u201d, \u201cnyu\u201d and \u201cnyo\u201d sounds above.<\/p>\n<h3>Small &#8220;tsu&#8221; (double consonants)<\/h3>\n<p>Some words, when written in Japanese, contain a small \u201ctsu\u201d inserted between other characters. When this is done, the word is pronounced with a tiny pause where the small \u201ctsu\u201d occurs, followed by an accentuation of the sound that follows the small \u201ctsu\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>This must always be a consonant sound, and usually a hard, unvoiced or half-voiced sound (k, s, t, p). When written in romaji, the small \u201ctsu\u201d is instead written as a double letter.<\/p>\n<p>Examples of words that have a small tsu\/double consonant include Sapporo, Hokkaido, Nissan, and Nippon (an alternative to the word \u201cNihon\u201d, meaning \u201cJapan\u201d, and often chanted by fans at international sporting events).<\/p>\n<h3>Even weighting of sounds, and no accents<\/h3>\n<p>When spoken, each kana character is given the same weighting, or an equal amount of time, and there is no accent placed on any of the characters.<\/p>\n<p>To demonstrate this, consider the city of Osaka. Many English speakers will naturally put the accent on the first \u201ca\u201d and draw out this sound, so it sounds something like \u201cOsaaka\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, when written in Japanese, Osaka is actually \u201c\u304a\u304a\u3055\u304b\u201d (\u201doosaka\u201d). Since each kana character is given equal time, Osaka is actually a four character word pronounced \u201co-o-sa-ka\u201d, with no accent anywhere, and the \u201co\u201d sound making up half of the word.<\/p>\n<p>The Japanese word for \u201chello\u201d is similar. As mentioned earlier, this should actually be pronounced \u201cko-n-ni-chi-wa\u201d, with a longer \u201cn\u201d sound than most English speakers normally say, and no accent on the first \u201ci\u201d (or anywhere else).<\/p>\n<p>(Note that in hiragana, &#8220;konnichiwa&#8221; should be written as \u300c\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u300d, since the \u300c\u306f\u300dis the particle pronounced &#8220;wa&#8221;. It&#8217;s a particle because the word as a whole is a contraction of a longer phrase that is basically never used in full. The same is true for &#8220;konbanwa&#8221;, which appears in the Practice Words section below.)<\/p>\n<p>Another example might be \u201ckarate\u201d. Like Osaka, the second syllable is usually accented by English speakers, but in fact equal time and weight should be given to each of \u201cka\u201d, \u201cra\u201d and \u201cte\u201d:<\/p>\n<h3>Elongated vowel sounds<\/h3>\n<p>When a sound is followed immediately by the same vowel sound, it is usually elongated as in the above example of \u201cOsaka\u201d. This applies whether the first of the repeated vowel sounds is paired with a consonant or not. For example, \u201ctoori\u201d, meaning \u201cstreet\u201d, has an elongated \u201co\u201d sound just the same as that in \u201cOsaka\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" data-css=\"tve-u-1601fff84f0\">street<\/p>\n<p>When written in romaji, my preferred method for expressing elongated sounds is with a line on the top of the vowel: \u0101, \u012b, \u016b, \u0113, \u014d. We can see this in &#8220;t\u014dri&#8221; above.<\/p>\n<p>The other main alternative is to repeat the vowel, effectively writing it as it would be typed in hiragana. In this case, however, note that an elongated &#8220;\u014d&#8221; sound is sometimes written as &#8220;ou&#8221;, as this is how some such words are written in hiragana, as explained below.<\/p>\n<p>When written in hiragana, elongated vowel sounds are usually expressed using the appropriate a-line character: \u304a\u3044\u3057\u3044 (oish\u012b = delicious), \u3058\u3085\u3046 (j\u016b = ten), etc. In the case of \u201co\u201d sounds, however, the elongation of the \u201co\u201d is often expressed with an \u300c\u3046\u300d instead of an \u300c\u304a\u300d, such as in \u300c\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u300d (arigat\u014d = thanks) and \u300c\u306b\u3061\u3088\u3046\u3073\u300d (nichiy\u014dbi = Sunday).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" data-css=\"tve-u-1601fff84f0\">delicious<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" data-css=\"tve-u-1601fff84f0\">ten<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" data-css=\"tve-u-1601fff84f0\">thanks<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" data-css=\"tve-u-1601fff84f0\">Sunday<\/p>\n<p>In katakana, rather than using the a-line character, elongated vowel sounds are written with a \u300c\u3061\u3087\u3046\u304a\u3093\u3077\u300d (ch\u014donpu), or \u201clong sound mark\u201d: \u300c\u30fc\u300d.
