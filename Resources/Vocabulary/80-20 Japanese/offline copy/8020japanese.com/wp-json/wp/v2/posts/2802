If you\u2019re not entirely sure what each of these is for, I recommend reading <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/japanese-characters-explained\/\">this article that explains the different character types<\/a> first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let\u2019s assume that you are at least interested in learning to read some characters. In that case, your first questions would be&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rw-indent\">Which ones, and in what order?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is pretty easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hiragana is, unquestionably, the place to start.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s the most \u201cJapanese\u201d form of writing, as it accounts for all of the unique sounds in Japanese, so all native Japanese words can be written in hiragana.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also used for the major grammatical parts of the language, like particles (a key component of <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/japanese-sentence-structure\/\">Japanese sentence structure<\/a>) and <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/verb-tense-cheat-sheet\/\">verb endings<\/a>, making it absolutely essential for reading anything written in Japanese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better yet, there are only 46 unique \u201cshapes\u201d to learn (there are 71 different characters, but 25 are just minor adaptations of some of the others), so it can be done fairly quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"367\" height=\"793\" src=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/hiragana.png\" alt=\"Hiragana chart\" class=\"wp-image-2828\" srcset=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/hiragana.png 367w, https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/hiragana-139x300.png 139w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px\" \/><figcaption>Hiragana Chart<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also absolutely clear when you\u2019ve learnt them all, making it a satisfying goal to aim for.

Since it\u2019s phonetic, <strong>it allows you to <em>see<\/em> every single sound<\/strong>, giving you a much clearer idea of how words are supposed to be pronounced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, <a href=\"https:\/\/8020japanese.com\/pronunciation\/\">correct pronunciation<\/a> can be the difference between being understood and not, and knowing hiragana helps with that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, take the words for \u201cbird\u201d and \u201cstreet\u201d:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><th>English<\/th><th>Romaji<\/th><th>Hiragana<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>bird<\/td><td>tori<\/td><td>\u3068\u308a<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>street<\/td><td>t\u014dri<\/td><td>\u3068\u304a\u308a<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In romaji, even though it is clear that the \u201co\u201d sound should be elongated in \u201dt\u014dri\u201d, you don\u2019t get a true sense of this just by looking at it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With hiragana, however, the \u201cto + o\u201d characters make up \u2154 of the word, and since <strong>each character in hiragana (and katakana) should generally be given the same amount of time<\/strong>, hiragana makes it much easier to properly appreciate the length that the \u201co\u201d sound should be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing hiragana also makes understanding certain parts of Japanese grammar more straightforward. For example, there are many adjectives that end in an elongated \u201ci\u201d sound, such as \u201coish\u012b\u201d (meaning &#8220;delicious&#8221;), and the conjugation of these adjectives is easier to see in hiragana. Take a look:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><th>Form<\/th><th>Romaji<\/th><th>Hiragana<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Regular<\/td><td><strong>oish<\/strong><em>\u012b<\/em> \/ <strong>oishi<\/strong>i<\/td><td><strong>\u304a\u3044\u3057<\/strong>\u3044<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Negative<\/td><td><strong>oish<em>i<\/em><\/strong> kunai<\/td><td><strong>\u304a\u3044\u3057<\/strong>\u304f\u306a\u3044<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Past tense<\/td><td><strong>oish<em>i<\/em><\/strong> katta<\/td><td><strong>\u304a\u3044\u3057<\/strong>\u304b\u3063\u305f<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Adverb<\/td><td><strong>oish<em>i<\/em><\/strong> ku<\/td><td> <strong>\u304a\u3044\u3057<\/strong>\u304f <\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In Hiragana, this transformation is very clear &#8211; simply remove the last &#8220;i&#8221; sound (\u3044) and replace it with either \u201ckunai\u201d, \u201ckatta\u201d, or &#8220;ku&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Romaji, it&#8217;s a bit messier. We need to shorten the elongated &#8220;i&#8221; sound, then add the appropriate ending. It&#8217;s not particularly difficult, but it\u2019s not as clear cut, and if you\u2019re not familiar with how words are written in hiragana, <strong>it\u2019s easy to make mistakes<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is particularly true when you consider that many adjectives, such as \u201comoi\u201d (heavy),&nbsp;end in a single \u201ci\u201d sound, not an elongated one, so there is no &#8220;i&#8221; sound at all before the other endings are added (&#8220;omokunai&#8221;, &#8220;omokatta&#8221;, &#8220;omoku&#8221;).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>These details matter, and paying attention to them is much easier with hiragana.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as I said, unless you only have fairly basic or specific goals for learning Japanese, it is worth the effort to learn hiragana. It will help you do more than just read &#8211; it will help you with your pronunciation, grammar, and ability to distinguish similar but different words.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"when-hiragana\">When should I start learning hiragana?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer to this is not as straightforward as you may think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might find this surprising, but I\u2019d argue that for most people, starting with hiragana at the very beginning will actually <em>hurt<\/em>, not help, your overall Japanese learning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because new characters complicate things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading hiragana with only beginner-level knowledge of it will be <em>substantially <\/em>slower than reading romaji.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes it a very inefficient way to learn. Consider this&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re trying to read a sentence with the goal of understanding it, perhaps as part of learning a new grammar concept. If you have to stop and think about each character to read it, and then piece the characters together for each and every word while also identifying where one word ends and the next begins&#8230; that\u2019s <strong>a lot of effort directed at something other than what you\u2019re actually trying to do<\/strong> in that moment, which is to <em>interpret the meaning of the sentence<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trying to do too many new things at once is usually counterproductive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any skill, your ability to read hiragana doesn\u2019t change instantly from \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d to \u201ccan\u201d. You start from zero and gradually get better the more you do it, so there\u2019s a difference between being \u201cable\u201d to read hiragana, and being proficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until you\u2019ve mastered hiragana, you\u2019re still in the process of learning it, even if you have reached the point where you can accurately read all of the characters without stopping to think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means that when you\u2019re trying to learn a new phrase or grammar concept, it\u2019s harder because you&#8217;re distracted. <strong>You can\u2019t focus all your effort on the thing you\u2019re trying to learn.<\/strong> Instead, a lot of that energy goes into simply reading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a bit like if you wanted to learn to juggle while riding a unicycle. You wouldn\u2019t start by trying to do both at the same time. Instead, you would practice both separately until you were good enough to combine them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get great at one skill first, then incorporate the other, or learn both to an adequate level individually before combining them &#8211; either can work. But if you jump on a unicycle and on day one start throwing balls in the air, you will get hurt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning to <em>read <\/em>Japanese and also <em>understand <\/em>it is the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that learning hiragana well enough to use it when studying the rest of the language doesn&#8217;t take too long, and unlike learning to ride a unicycle, you\u2019re not likely to hurt yourself while doing it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, <strong>I often recommend people start learning basic vocabulary and grammar using romaji, and leave reading and writing until a bit later.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By removing the need to learn characters, you have one less obstacle to learning the spoken language and everything that goes with it &#8211; particularly vocabulary and grammar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By doing this, you can learn a legitimately useful amount of spoken Japanese much faster, since you\u2019re not having to battle with unfamiliar characters at the same time. Then, when you\u2019re ready, you can take some time to get your hiragana reading skills up to scratch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The effects of this on your ability to stay motivated, particularly in the early days, can be substantial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll just have to ignore the purists who think romaji is stupid. It may not be \u201creal\u201d Japanese, but it&#8217;s a useful tool that has its place in the learning process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group rw-sidebar\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Different approaches<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there are other ways to go about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you can get <em>really <\/em>good at reading hiragana first before moving onto other things. That can work, but the big drawback is that you don\u2019t have the context of useful, meaningful language to which you can properly apply the characters you learn, so it will likely be both harder and less effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A better option would be to learn to read hiragana while learning other aspects of the language using romaji. That is, learning both side-by-side without combining them &#8211; yet. This is a good option as it gives you a bit more balance, and ensures you are moving forward on multiple fronts at the same time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main drawback is that it means taking time from getting your vocabulary and grammar knowledge up to a useful level to study and practice your reading skills. This can reduce some of the motivational boosters you get from learning something really useful. That said, you\u2019re going to do that at some point anyway, so it\u2019s not necessarily a worse approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sort of depends on you, and how well you are able to stay motivated through the early stages of learning. For most people, quick wins are essential, and learning useful vocab and grammar is typically more motivating than being able to read some characters without being able to really use them.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"katakana\">Should I learn Katakana?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, the answer to this is fairly easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In almost all cases, yes.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Particularly if you\u2019ve made the effort to learn hiragana, then taking the next step to learn katakana is usually worth it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, this again depends on your goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve only learnt hiragana to gain a better appreciation of pronunciation and grammar concepts, as discussed above, then you <em>could<\/em> stop there. A focus on purely spoken Japanese won&#8217;t benefit as much from learning katakana as from hiragana.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you ultimately want to be able to read Japanese, then you absolutely need to learn katakana.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katakana is used for all loanwords (ie. words imported from other languages), of which there are a ton used in everyday Japanese. Even the word \u201cr\u0101men\u201d is typically written in katakana &#8211; that\u2019s how prevalent it is. It\u2019s also used a lot in advertising and other forms of signage, making it virtually essential for navigating everyday life in Japan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"when-katakana\">When should I start learning katakana? <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This part is easy too. If you&#8217;re going to learn it&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start learning katakana after you\u2019ve become thoroughly proficient at reading hiragana.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hiragana is much more central to the language, so you certainly want to learn that first, and learn it properly. Only then should you move onto katakana.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does \u201cthoroughly proficient\u201d mean? Basically, it\u2019s when you rarely have to think for more than a split second when trying to read anything written in hiragana.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have to completely master hiragana first. You just want to be good enough at it that you don\u2019t constantly get stuck trying to read it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"rw-sidebar\">Something that almost everyone finds, including Japanese people, is that katakana is just harder to read than hiragana, so don\u2019t be discouraged if it takes you significantly longer to get used to it. It\u2019s blocky and doesn\u2019t flow very well. It\u2019s appropriate that katakana is sometimes used for emphasis much like ALL CAPS in English, because both were clearly not designed for easy, fluid reading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kanji\">Should I learn Kanji?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether or not you learn kanji really comes down to how far you want to take your Japanese skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, if you\u2019ve decided to learn to read Japanese, it\u2019s a bit of an all-or-nothing endeavour. If you\u2019ve learnt hiragana and katakana, you&#8217;ve probably already decided that you want to learn at least some kanji too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some ways, learning hiragana and katakana without learning kanji is a bit pointless, as it limits you greatly in how much real-world Japanese you can read.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, hiragana and katakana can be enough to survive if you only have basic needs. As always, it depends on your goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"when-kanji\">When should I start learning kanji?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning kanji will, invariably, take a considerable amount of time. The reality is that you will spend the majority of your Japanese learning journey trying to keep up with all of the kanji you encounter, so it helps to get started early.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, when you&#8217;re just getting started, learning a few kanji won&#8217;t really help you much in the real world. You&#8217;ll get more bang for your buck by focusing on grammar and vocabulary, so just like it can be a good idea to delay learning hiragana for a while, the same is true for kanji.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, there is no perfect time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waiting until you\u2019re proficient in hiragana and katakana is a good approach, but it can be fun to start learning a few right from the beginning too. For some people, learning kanji is extremely rewarding and motivating, so if that&#8217;s you, dive straight in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the day, motivation is probably the most important factor when learning a language&#8230; or anything else for that matter. If learning loads of kanji makes you feel good, do it. If it feels like running in quicksand, hold off and focus on other aspects for a while instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One additional question that applies to kanji specifically is&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-many-kanji\">How many kanji do I need to learn?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I sound like a broken record at this point, but again, this entirely depends on your goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to be able to read everything you might ever come across, you would theoretically need to learn all of the J\u014dy\u014d Kanji &#8211; 2136 unique characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the 80\/20 principle certainly applies here. That is, you will be able to read ~80% of everyday written Japanese with just the most common ~20%. It\u2019s very much a game of diminishing returns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s very rough, of course, but <a href=\"https:\/\/scriptin.github.io\/kanji-frequency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this analysis by Dmitry Shpika<\/a> shows it\u2019s not actually too far off. The most common 100 kanji account for roughly 40% of all characters seen across a range of media. To get to 80%, you need about 500 (or about 23% of the J\u014dy\u014d Kanji).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main takeaway here is this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You don\u2019t need to learn every kanji to gain a useful level of reading ability.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s typically a long, ongoing process, and each additional kanji is, on average, less useful than the previous one. Rather than having a set target, I personally think how you approach learning kanji is more important. That, however, is a separate matter entirely that I\u2019ll talk about another time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"key-takeaways\">Key Takeaways<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve covered a lot of specific details about why you should or shouldn\u2019t learn hiragana, katakana and kanji &#8211; here&#8217;s a quick summary:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Should you learn hiragana, katakana and kanji?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In almost all cases, yes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only if your goals are very basic or specific should you expect to get by only reading\/writing romaji. It&#8217;s also helpful for improving pronunciation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What order should you learn them in?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Easy. Hiragana first, then katakana, then kanji.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mix it up a bit if you want, but focus on mastering hiragana in particular before getting too deep into the others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When should you learn them?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is trickier. You can start straight away, but you\u2019ll learn basic grammar and vocabulary faster if you wait a little.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining Bambi-like reading skills with other aspects of the language is slow, frustrating and counterproductive, so it&#8217;s usually not the best idea to dive head-first into everything all at once.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you start, learn hiragana and katakana separately from the other aspects of the language, then merge them into your other study efforts only when you are reasonably proficient, unicycle-juggler style.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019ve often said that, as a language, Japanese is simple if approached the right way.
