					<description><![CDATA[Hello Richard, 
Thank you for the availability of this wonderful resource. I have only been able to hear the &#039;a&#039; sound in the kana and some of the words you use later. Is this deliberate, or should I be doing something to access all of the voice options. With thanks]]></description>
