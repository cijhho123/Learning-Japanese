					<description><![CDATA[I find Richard&#039;s book very easy to follow and understand. It&#039;s better than &#039;Japanese for busy people&#039; and &#039;Genki&#039;. However I don&#039;t connect with the audio files that come with the 82/20 book, because I think that their objective is off-target. If I&#039;m listening to the lessons in the car, I don&#039;t wish to hear an exact version of the whole textbook read out at quite a fast speed. If there were sentences with an opportunity for me to say it myself before hearing the correct version - a kind of audio tuition (or even short conversation pieces), that would be much more useful in my view. So apart from trying to hear how certain words or phrases are said, I don&#039;t use the audio files. Shame, a lost opportunity.]]></description>
