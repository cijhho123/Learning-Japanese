					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://8020japanese.com/particle-wo/#comment-5204&quot;&gt;RAMIRO&lt;/a&gt;.

I was told by my Japanese teacher that even for intransitive verb like 出る or 離れる, as long as you are exiting from a place, the location you are exiting from should be marked by を. Similarly for verbs like 歩く, 走る or 散歩する, the place you are walking, running or strolling through should be marked by を.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Taro ate the Sushi&quot; vs &quot;Taro rode the train.&quot; Does the distinction arise because Taro causes the state of the Sushi to change? I can tell the the Sushi has been eaten by someone. I can&#039;t necessarily tell whether the train has been ridden by someone (unless they leave the carriage in a filthy state).]]></description>
