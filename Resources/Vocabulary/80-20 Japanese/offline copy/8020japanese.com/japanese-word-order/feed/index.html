					<description><![CDATA[How come in the various example sentences you&#039;ve given, sometimes the timing is followed by the &quot;ni&quot; particle and sometimes it&#039;s not?

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh my gosh... You are a genius, seriously!  Your article on Japanese Sentence Structure is hands down the best I&#039;ve read on the subject.  I have no idea how you have accomplished what no-one else seems to be able to:  teach someone in very simple terms how to structure a sentence in Japanese.

I&#039;ve read so many websites on the subject and the articles are very confusing.  Some assume you have a PhD in English to even understand the grammatical terms they use.  I love, love, love your articles!  That one, along with this one should be mandatory reading for ALL students.

Thank you so very much for providing them - I&#039;m so excited that I&#039;m going to buy your book right now :-)]]></description>
