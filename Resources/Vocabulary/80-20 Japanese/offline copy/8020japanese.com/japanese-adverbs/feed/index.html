					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://8020japanese.com/japanese-adverbs/#comment-122&quot;&gt;Þórir Pétur Pétursson&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks Þórir! I&#039;m really pleased to hear that my explanations have helped clear up some of your confusion.

As for your question, I can certainly see where you are coming from. While I generally think the situation you describe is unlikely, I believe it is possible for such an ambiguity to arise.

I can actually think of one example using the word 「本当に」(hontō ni), meaning &quot;really&quot;. I suppose this could be used before 「とても」 (totemo) or similar adverbs in a sentence like this:

kanojo wa hontō ni totemo shizuka ni hon wo yomimashita.
かのじょ は ほんとう に とても しずか に ほん を よみました。
彼女は本当にとても静かに本を読みました。

The 「本当に」(hontō ni) could either apply to 「とても」 (totemo) to emphasise that her reading was &quot;really very quiet&quot;, or it could apply to the verb to mean &quot;she really did read very quietly&quot;. 

So, yes, it appears that this kind of ambiguity is possible, although generally I don&#039;t think there are many situations where the meaning would not be clear, especially once context is taken into account.

I hope that helps! Thanks again for your comment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://8020japanese.com/japanese-adverbs/#comment-120&quot;&gt;Andy&lt;/a&gt;.

Good question, Andy. The negative form itself is not an adverb, no - I would treat them the same as i-adjectives.

In fact, because of this, the negative forms themselves can be turned into adverbs in the same way, eg. takai → takakunai → takakunaku. Words like this do get used, too, although the only common situation I can think of is with the verbs suru/shimasu and naru/narimasu. That forms a kind of set expression that I&#039;ll have to cover some other time.

I hope that answers your question :)]]></description>
