					<description><![CDATA[My first language used in the home was Castillian Spanish - Mexican in other words. My father forbad use of English although he was a naturaized American and well versed with English. My point is that as I have been studying Nihongo over a two year period, I slowly improve (I guess Bambi-like) but my vocabulary has grown and I am happy about that. Translations take time as the Hiragana and Katakana character reading tire my eyes out so, I can seem slow. But what I want to underline is that the longer I study Nihongo the more it reinforces my SPANISH!!! Has anyone ever shared that with you? I walk away from my Nihongo lesson and I walk into another room thinking to myself IN SPANISH!  So,I ask myself to speak to myself in Japanese!!  I really enjoy studying Japanese but I am a do it myselfer -- One day I will get this down --- I am determined  Thanks for the sentence structure cheat sheet.  Last inquiry is is there a similar cheat sheet emphasizing  to, mi, ni mo, i, wa, o -- how to nail down proper transitions ??  Thank you -- Arigato gozai masu]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is all very useful and clear, Richard. I started with Romaji and then moved over to Hiragana and Katakana later on. Yes, it is a burden to learn these Japanese alphabets - but you truly CANNOT progress until they are embedded in your memory. Think of other languages with different alphabets like Russian or Greek. You could use a kind of &#039;Romaji&#039; for them too. And yet, you cannot say that you&#039;re starting to &#039;crack&#039; the language until you can navigate around the original alphabets. I found that mastering H +K was ESSENTIAL along the way to saying that I&#039;m really progressing with Japanese. Otherwise you are forever &#039;on the outside, looking in&#039;. My suggestion: don&#039;t make Romaji a crutch for yourself. 
Good luck,
Mike]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Richard, thank you for two very useful and interesting articles. I have often wondered why the whole written Japanese language could not all be in hiragana. Now I know and understand.
Best regards
