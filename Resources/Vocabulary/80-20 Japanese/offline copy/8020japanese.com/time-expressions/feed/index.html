					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re doing a great job here Richard, I love the way you structure everything step by step and in plain grammar.
Perhaps what I love the most are those diagrams, they really aid learning.

Thanks Richard, you should write some more blogs, I&#039;ll be sure to read them and I&#039;m sure many more people will.

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Richard,
I was working with your work order practice Excel sheet. 
On row 42 there is this &#039;He came here by car on Thursday.&#039; and this translates to „Åã„Çå „ÅØ „ÇÇ„Åè„Çà„ÅÜ„Å≥„Åè„Çã„Åæ „Åß „Åì„Åì „Å´ „Åç„Åæ„Åó„Åü
Now according the explaination above I would expect a „Å´ after „ÇÇ„Åè„Çà„ÅÜ„Å≥ but there is none. Could you explain this or is this a problem with the sheet?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://8020japanese.com/time-expressions/#comment-3966&quot;&gt;Marie Brennan&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks Marie! Great to hear the article got you thinking about time phrases in a way you hadn&#039;t before. And I&#039;m glad that, for the second group, &quot;absolute timing&quot; was the idea that resonated with you. I guess I&#039;d prefer you felt I over-explained it than the opposite :)]]></description>
