					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://8020japanese.com/desu/#comment-6327&quot;&gt;Rahul&lt;/a&gt;.

This is not only a &#034;suuuper&#034; late reply, but also a &#034;suuuper&#034; false one..
The sentence まさこさんはしょくどうです has exactly one meaning, which is

&#034;As for Masako-san, (she/it) is a cafeteria.&#034;

This sentence usually wouldn&#039;t make any sense, especially if the previous question was about where she currently is. But maybe someone named their cafeteria Masako-san and we&#039;re all wrong within our assumptions here..

Joke aside, so this basically means that you use です exactly as it was explained here, namely in a X &#x3D; Y sentence.
The reason why this particular formula doesn&#039;t work in order to say &#034;Masako is at the cafeteria.&#034; is because this is actually NOT a X &#x3D; Y sentence, but instead it&#039;s a X *does* Y one.
Why? Because Masako does something here. What does she do? Existing. Where? At the cafeteria.
This is why you use a verb. For animated existing things this would be いる / います and the particle に to describe where she exists.

So no, even your example of &#034;when talking about まさこさん, is here&#034; would not be a sentence where です is being used, but still いる / います in combination with a particle that comes after the location &#034;here&#034; - e.g. ここに or something similar.

Hope this helps.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Please allow me to share this observation in response to: 

“ Where’s the verb? The first one has an obvious verb, and the second has the copula verb 「です」, but what about the last sentence?

As I noted earlier, Japanese sentences do not actually need a verb to be grammatically complete – they need a predicate.

Since i-adjectives are by themselves predicates, sentences like the following are grammatically complete:

やきそば は おいしい。
焼やきそばはおいしい。
This is correct informal Japanese meaning, “Yakisoba is delicious”, even though there is no word that means “is”.

How is this possible?

Because in this case, 「おいしい」 is the predicate – a “verb phrase” that effectively includes the meaning of the verb “to be” within itself.

Hence, in this context, 「おいしい」 effectively means, “is delicious”.

That’s right – Japanese adjectives behave like verbs in some situations. They are basically super-words that are both adjectives and verbs rolled into one. This is very different to English.

Remember what we said about Japanese people using words like 「おいしい」 and 「かわいい」 by themselves to describe things? They can do this because in this context, these words are actually predicates that effectively mean “is delicious” or “is cute”.
In addition, since Japanese sentences only need a predicate (unlike English sentences which must have a subject), they are, by themselves, complete sentences; there is no need to explicitly say “This is…” or “That is so…”.”

I hope this following idea will be helpful:

Do you like sushi? 寿司が好きですか。
Yes.はい。suppressed superfluous grammar.
Yes I do.はいそうします。suppressed subject.
Yes I like sushi.はい寿司が好き。suppressed do/する(です) Normal in both the English and Japanese languages.
Yes, I do like sushi.はい、寿司が好きです。unsuppressed emphatic do/する/です
Like! 好きい！English and Japanese can replace the subject with contextual proximity by looking at, pointing at, or holding the subject as conversational context. Normal in both languages.

Why complicate and confuse a simple style of speech that has equals in both languages? Focus on similarities, not differences. Keep it simple.
Super-dooper adjectival-verby-predicate things are too much to explain because they simply don’t exist.

But we all use fanciful language to explain things we don’t fully understand.

Appreciate your work, and sharing. Thank you]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://8020japanese.com/desu/#comment-4761&quot;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;.

This is a suuuper late reply, but I had the same confusion a little while ago too. Although Webb says that です is the same as saying X = Y, it&#039;s more of an approximate meaning, rather than literally saying, &#039;x and y are the exact same thing&#039; so for the sentence まさこさんはしょくどうです its more like saying &quot;when talking about まさこさん, is here&quot; Yes, you can also say まさこさんはしょくどうにいます&quot;, these two sentences literally share the exact same meaning, but using the います version is more directly translated to &quot;まさこさん exists in the dining room&quot;, so using that variation places more emphasis on the fact that she exists somewhere.

Cheers.]]></description>

I&#039;m not an expert but I believe the answer doesn&#039;t make sense in this form. 
The question here can be translated as &quot;Masako is where?&quot; The answer given is &quot;Masako is a cafeteria/dining hall&quot; which doesn&#039;t make sense. 
In this instance you should use imasu instead of desu so the reply would be まさこさんはしょくどうにいます (&quot;Masako exists in the cafeteria)]]></description>
