Guide and online resources for learning Japanese, will be continuously updated as I learn the langauge.  

## Step 1: Learning Kana

### Hiragana
Hiragana is one of the three core scripts in the Japanese writing system, alongside katakana and kanji. It’s a syllabary: each character represents a single syllable such as a vowel, a consonant plus vowel (like ka), or the special nasal sound n. Its name literally means "ordinary kana," reflecting its use in everyday, informal writing as opposed to the more formal kanji. In modern Japanese, hiragana is essential for writing grammatical elements such as particles, verb and adjective endings (okurigana), and native words whose kanji are uncommon or nonexistent.


The ability to read hiragana is going to be a prerequisite for most beginner Japanese textbooks and resources.  It is vital to memorize the Kana and along with it the sound system when learning Japanese. It can normally be done within days to weeks depending on the individual and will be used in almost every Japanese sentence onwards.

### katakana
Katakana is one of the three main writing systems in Japanese. It’s a syllabary: each character represents a syllable rather than a single phoneme, and consists of about 46 basic signs that parallel hiragana in sound but differ in appearance. Today, it’s primarily used for transcribing foreign loanwords, writing foreign names, onomatopoeia, scientific and technical terms, and for emphasis: kind of like italics in English.

## Step 2 - Learning Grammar
Once you're comfortable with both hiragana and katakana, the essential next phase is to build a solid foundation in grammar, while progressively expanding your vocabulary and starting basic kanji study.  
Grammar is the framework of a language, including the rules for how words are formed, arranged into sentences, and how they convey meaning. It governs word order, punctuation, verb forms, and other structures, acting as a system that helps ensure messages are clear and understood by others.

## Step 3 - kanji

## Step 4 - Vocabulary

## Step 5 - Listening & Speaking Practice
Engaging in regular listening and speaking exercises is crucial for reinforcing grammar and vocabulary in context. This practice helps bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Incorporate the following activities into your routine:

* **Listening Practice**: Immerse yourself in Japanese audio materials such as podcasts, news broadcasts, and language learning platforms. This will enhance your ability to understand spoken Japanese and familiarize you with various accents and speaking speeds.

* **Speaking Practice**: Regularly practice speaking Japanese, even if it's just reading aloud from textbooks or repeating phrases from audio resources. This builds confidence and improves pronunciation.

* **Language Exchange**: Engage in conversations with native speakers or fellow learners through language exchange platforms. This provides real-life practice and feedback.


## Step 6 - Reading Practice
Building on your knowledge of kana, grammar, and kanji, it's time to enhance your reading skills. Engaging with Japanese texts not only reinforces vocabulary and grammar but also immerses you in the language's natural flow. Start with materials tailored to your proficiency level and gradually challenge yourself with more complex content.

## Step 7 -  Writing Practice
Writing in Japanese helps solidify your understanding of grammar structures, vocabulary, and kanji. It also enhances your ability to organize thoughts and communicate effectively in the language.

## Step 8: Cultural Immersion (AJATT)
**AJATT (All Japanese All The Time)** is an immersion-based language learning method that emphasizes surrounding yourself with Japanese content in your daily life. By integrating the language into various aspects of your routine, you can accelerate your learning process and develop a more intuitive understanding of Japanese.&#x20;

**Key Components:**

* **Comprehensive Input:** Engage with Japanese media such as TV shows, movies, music, and books. The goal is to consume content that is both enjoyable and linguistically rich. ([Tatsumoto Ren][1])

* **Active and Passive Immersion:** Combine focused listening and reading (active immersion) with background exposure (passive immersion) to reinforce learning. ([Tatsumoto Ren][2])

* **Sentence Mining:** Extract sentences from the content you consume and add them to your study routine. This helps in understanding context, grammar, and vocabulary usage.&#x20;

* **Consistency:** Regular and consistent exposure to Japanese is crucial. Aim to incorporate the language into your daily life as much as possible. ([WaniKani Community][3])
